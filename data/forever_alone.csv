ForeverAlone,"Hello everyone

I've been lurking here on and off for some time now, (though a few might recall a DM I've sent their way), and I feel the need to express my thoughts on some of the common conversations that go on here. I can't be sure how this will be received, and you're welcome to react as you wish, but I want to be honest with you folks.

To disclose a tad, I'm a twenty something man, with an incredibly midling physique who only a few years since being overweight. I keep my hair long as well as an unkempt beard that makes me look 8 years older and makes people confuse me with anything between vape lounge residents to drug dealers (a person once walked up to me on the street, unprompted, to ask ""if I've got some on me right now""). I play video games for give or take 18 years as my primary time sink and recently I've spent plenty of time thinking about WWE (especially the recent Wrestlemania), having gone back to it. I study within the social sciences field. Despite my hobbies, I'm anything but masculine, as I'll hug anyone who lets me, and I call my mates ""dears"" and ""sweethearts"" at a whim. I dont drive and don't know a thing about cars, most DIY activities and chores (tho I can chop wood).

I'm also in a relationship, my first one, and I'm in it for some time now, though I've had my share of attempts and heartbreaks along the way, but more on that later.

I find people fascinating, and I try to extend love and respect to any (who are within bounds of decency). Maybe that's one of the reasons I'm attracted to this place, to observe others and maybe take something away from it, though I will also admit that I've grappled with FA feelings for a sizable amount of time, so a lot of what goes on here is not so foreign to me.

I'd like to say first of all that wanting a relationship is indeed okay. Certain people and communities will try to downplay the want and importance, and if those people feel that way, I think it's fine, but one should not be ashamed for something like that. I wanted a relationship since I was 16. That being said, I want folks here to hear me out on some things concerning relationships. The cuddling, finishing each other's sentences and what not is neat, but one should keep in mind that a relationship is a commitment unlike any other. You open yourself to another person in a way you wont to anyone else, and why it results in intimacy and other things we want, it also results in hardship. The honeymoon period of my relationship was filled carefree, as we're trying to feel each other out, but after that time, and we got more used to each other's company, the other parts of a relationship came around, namely, being there for another person, often in the form of phone calls in the dead of night because someone's anxiety is enroaching, having the other person be silent on you because someone is troubling them and you dont know what's going on, and trying to help them. Not to mention, tensions do indeed flare up, whether it's misunderstandings, clashes of personality or straight up deception, and which point one or both of us wonder if this relationship will still go on. It's getting rambly, but I want to point out that a relationship is not a Panacea. I dont want to imply that you have to be super enthusiastic and jumping of joy all the time to see yourself with a partner, but if you have issues with yourself, they wont simply be resolved because a person chooses to be with you. At this point, if you're deceitful about what sort of person you, it also shows. I still felt inadequacy over myself while within the relationship, for instance. And within the intimacy of a relationship,  your weaknesses and strengths as a person are made known to the other person, at which point you cant hide.

I've felt romantic feelings towards other people, many of which unsuccessful, but I tried to take away something from each. The first real crush I've had was for a girl in my class. We got on well, but talked rarely. Regardless, I've looked at her and dreamed of being together for many years (we ended up in the same university). She was aware of it through a mutual friend, as I later found out, but I cant be sure how that affected our interaction. And at one point she just left to a different place and nothing happened, so all that longing went for nothing for I didn't act. On the second go, I met a girl who I quickly fell for, once again, we got on pretty well, and I determined that I want a relationship with her. I started acting different, more suggestively, trying to give her hints that I'm interested in a relationship with her, but never pulled the trigger all the way down. Maybe she caught on, but our relationship quickly crumbled. I even tried to quasi-manipulate a girl into a relationship, as she was heartbroken and vulnerable (had a hard breakup in a long term relationship), and nearly killed our friendship because of it. I didn't hate those girls, they're cool, but I let my feelings for them get in the way of a natural relationship taking place, because on my mind I always had the idea that all of our interaction is a prelude to a relationship, and it would just ""happen"", but it never did. Though I tried to gain experience, I did experience FA feelings, and started accepting them, because it never worked out, and it seemed others have it so easy. As for who I now call my partner, we met randomly, and shared hobbies, and a relationship didn't occur to me, until feelings cropped up again, and after a bit of time, I decided to pull the trigger, win or lose, as I was not prepared to long at a person from a distance for years, hoping something just ""happens"". She shot me down, actually, because she didn't feel ready for a relationship, but we decided to carry our friendship on regardless, and after some more time, she started reciprocating and we decided to give this love thing a shot (and our results were outlined earlier).

I hope my personal experience showed you the sort of background I'm coming from. I want to emphasize - relationships are hard work, and they don't just ""happen"" - initiative must take place. You don't have to be a an 8 or a 9 or whatever (I despise this notation, it's dehumanizing), but you have to move towards opportunities. Dont expect the person to bear all of your emotional weight - you have to have peace in yourself and hold interest in life (whatever you're into) to be able to be with another. I know rejection sucks - I could fill playlists with all the songs I couldn't listen to because they reminded me of a girl I tried to fall in love with - and I know that others had harsher experiences, but if you believe in relationships and being with someone through whatever life tosses at you, it's all but a roadblock, not a wall. Don't disregard non-romantic relationships if you have them, because your friends and family matter a great deal - I wouldn't be where I am now if I didn't have a few friends who looked out for me, and helped me cope and supported my romantic endeavours. Don't feel pressured by friends, if you're having a rough go at relationships, as it breeds jealousy and endagers your relations.

If one person makes it through this wall, I'll be satisfied. If you feel that I'm wrong, or want a clarification or such, or just a conversation to hold you over (Roman Reigns should've lost), leave a comment, I'll be around to respond whenever, and I'll respond to the best of my ability.

ForeverAlone,"It's kinda fascinating and sad. Recently I learnt that Marmoset monkeys, after leaving their families, form these social groups where only one dominant male and dominant female gets to be in an intimate relationship. They will stay next to each other and have sex all the time. When other Marmoset monkeys in the group try to mate, even among themselves, they will be forcibly hurt by the dominant monkey of their own sex. Basically you're either having sex all the time or being a slave raising babies and finding food for the dominant couple. At least as humans we have the chance to mate with others on our level and don't have to pay directly for other people's children.",Most Marmoset Monkeys stay virgins for their whole lives,SuitableStart

ForeverAlone,"I in a house that is not my but for some reason I feel like I owned it there was only one bedroom one office room one bathroom and one kitchen the Office room floor tech streaming equipment maybe to reflect on my passion in my current career The kitchen was calm modern but simple in the bedroom had a relaxing aura about it it seemed familiar like I‚Äôve been here before The living room is just your basic TV and couch normal shit you see in any household later on I get a phone call from my phone but it was different to the one I use right now is unrecognizable even it‚Äôs like I jump to a new timeline of tech it looks similar to any phone these days but something about it‚Äôs structure it‚Äôs UI is different, The call was made by someone named Maria for some reason that name won‚Äôt get out of my head even when I‚Äôm writing this, She was crying and telling that she needed to see me ASAP because of something next thing I noticed time skip for a month I can still remember the date it was 6/7/27 some how I was 2027 after a phone with Maria, She was starting with me for a month as she told me do to an accident with her family that she was living with and I was the only person that she could turn to for help for some reason I felt a calming feeling for her I don‚Äôt know why but something about her felt good like The whispers of an ocean current in the beach, Next I heard a knock at my front door I opened it, And it was her I looked behind me and the house looks different before they were some photos mostly me and my family not much but enough to remember them by but now with locations like the Grand Canyon Mount Rushmore the Lincoln Memorial Las Vegas and some from Disneyland for some reason she and I had a bond of sorts, I let her in the House I saw the outside was raining but I see nothing else but just shadow not darkness but just shadow bleak only fragments of lights around the end it‚Äôs like set dressing for a film or video game, I closed in shock of what I saw and over a thunderbolt I was storm brewing in from the outside I walk over to her when she was sitting down the couch or in her pajamas watching a movie I couldn‚Äôt get a good glimpse of it but I think it was Pacific Rim from what I remembered from one scene in Tokyo when they were fighting a fucking Kaiju, I sit down next to next her and she smiling at me for some reason I feel like I was happy in a way that I‚Äôve never felt before in my life that feeling terrified me she some how felt what I was feeling and she asked ‚ÄúWhy are afraid of me?‚Äù I ‚Äúsaid I don‚Äôt know‚Äù it felt like I was going to die there was an aching in my head like somethings trying to claw itself out from the sides of my head she says ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have to be afraid of what you love and you don‚Äôt have to hate it to avoid it to not let it kill you‚Äù I ask while I was in pain on my knees the living room went black an endless void of dark all I can see is my hands my legs my body and just her, I asked her why I must suffer for this emotion that I fear it may cost my life next she held out her hand and said ‚ÄúCome here let me help break does chains of fear is far more greater than death‚Äù some how she pulled me in towards her like she was using the Force or some shit I felt A calm breeze flow through me through my mind to my hands she held them and said ‚Äú I know you can find me just don‚Äôt let the one‚Äôs come to you and take or destroy what you created‚Äù then she held both of my hands and bowed her head to mine then I see a light growing ever so brighter glowing like the sun then I wake up but I heard her voice and she said ‚ÄúRemember who you are‚Äù what does any of this mean?!!?",I had a very bizarre dream,TheAceEmperor

ForeverAlone,"I know, pretty obvious right? But it's just crazy to me being at the state that I'm in rn to think about the fact that some people will for real never understand what it feels like to be this unfortunate in the dating game. I'm not talking about never being rejected because common sense tells us that we've all been there. I just feel like it's much MUCH easier for some to bounce back from said rejections because unlike some of us here they're not shit out of luck and actually have options. So no biggie really.

Now with this being as obvious of a fact as it is I wouldn't really have as much of a problem with this fact if some of these same people weren't condescending to those with no luck with girls with their ""obviously you're never gonna get anywhere if you don't put in the work""...the funny thing about this argument is there's a good chance the people they're addressing worked 10x hardee than they did to get theirs but are so convinced that it's lack of effort that fucks people over at the end of the day. For some people yes it does, but not everybody and I feel like that's what a good portion of people don't seem to understand. You don't always fail because you didn't try. Some of us out here put in the work day in and day out and still end up right back to square one, that's just how life is unfortunately in every aspect of success not just the dating game.

Now I know some people are gonna look at posts like these and go ""congrats, you figured out life is unfair to some and not others. What are you gonna do about it?"" well that's just the thing. What can a person in that predicament do besides work himself to the grave with the possibility of never seeing the ""fruits of thy labor"". The obvious solution is to keep pushing, but some of us have pushed for so long with no results it honestly feels like a waste of time. Coming to subs like this to bitch and vent is therapeutic because it feels good to get it off your chest every now and then and it's good to know you're not the only one suffering. Some lurkers here may not like it and take it as a use of meaningless complaining etc etc but honestly fuck those people and their condescending commentary. Let people express their frustration. It's cool to give advice so they don't stay here but don't demonize people for letting off some steam.

ForeverAlone,"I know there is that saying, ‚Äúthere is someone out there for everyone‚Äù

You can go on a ratings site and get rated by people, some will say yes your attractive, others will say no your not, and then some will say somewhat attractive. 

So it got me thinking that the way attraction works, solely depends on a persons personal viewpoint.

Not everyone will have the same taste, what one person thinks is attractive another person may think differently.

Basically I‚Äôm like a 4/10 and very short, but I‚Äôm in good shape body-wise.

Anyway. I‚Äôve been on one date like 2 years ago from online dating. I was very nervous on the date because I had never dated before, so no shit I‚Äôm going to be nervous. She texted me and said she wasn‚Äôt romantically interested, which is fine. But that‚Äôs the extent of my dating history. That‚Äôs literally it. I‚Äôm 25 and that‚Äôs all I got. I‚Äôve tried relentlessly to do new shit, to meet new people. No luck. 

I‚Äôm an engineer at a major corporation and make very good money. Doesn‚Äôt matter though. No one cares. I slave away my life and come home to nothing. All I have are numbers growing in a savings acct with nothing to spend it on. But hey, at least I‚Äôll be able to afford a co-op soon, right?! So then I can be lonely AND a property owner!

I have been having dreams about girls being interested in me, in an innocent high school sort of way. Nothing sexual, just a genuine interest between me and a girl. The feeling of butterflies, excitement. That made me realize that I have never experienced this in real life. Nothing even close. No girl has ever ever ever shown interest in me. I‚Äôve never experienced true connection with anyone and, again, not even fucking close. 

I will likely be alone forever. It only gets worse as you get older. Women expect you in your late 20s into your 30s to have experience, to know how relationships work even if only at a rudimentary level. I know nothing. To know how to have sex, to please her. I am a 25 yo virgin, I don‚Äôt know anything. 

I pretty much give up on trying. It only cause emotional pain. The constant rejection from online dating apps, from meetups and at bars. I never had a chance. I just focus on my career, stacking cash, but I know it‚Äôs a meaningless pursuit, though it does provide a sense of progression and of moving forward. But the longing for a nice, sweet, caring woman who I can have a family with and share experiences with, that longing irks me still. 

In the age of social media, of tinder, of obsessions with appearance, I never stood a chance. From the moment I was conceived I was meant to be a cog in the machine; to produce and to keep my mouth shut, to enjoy my material wealth and to just be content with that alone, but of course it all means nothing without connection, belonging, feeling wanted, appreciated.

I am making a [location independent dating app](https://www.fairytrail.app/) \- the first ever dating app for people with a remote work lifestyle or open to relocating to find love. 

Several facts:

* Free (just email me to get verified if you don't want to pay $3)
* 10k+ members (50% are fully remote, 43% aspire to be)
* Balanced gender ratio - 56% women members
* No bots - all users are screened before they can match
* Beta - your feedback really counts here and we are constantly improving the app

This is my passion project and my day job is product management at a startup. I have a 2021 goal to turn this into my full time job. Previously I tried regular dating apps and noticed that where I lived had a huge impact on my dating experience/success. I'd be open to moving if it meant being with someone I love and this is my attempt to solve this.

ForeverAlone,"I never cared for personal media, I use it casually, mostly for the meme groups and stuff.

But I rarely ever get added as a friend. At my work, there is this guy who when you start working at the same place, he automatically searches you on Facebook and adds you. I was the only person not added by him, but I rather sent him the friend request. After a few months, he removed only me.

I'm not really active on FB, I don't post out of self esteem issues, but my coworkers aren't active as much either..

&amp;#x200B;

Some new guy joined the work, I had the pleasure with working with him on his first week, we befriended each other, he even told me he found me the coolest guy at work so far. Well, once he switched jobs, he removed only me, none of my other coworkers.

I had my friend get a girlfriend, one of those clingy types, I tried to make her welcome to our friend meets (since she couldn't let go of her BF for one night in the week). I had the feeling she hated me, since I was the devil pulling my best friend away from her (even tho she tagged along on every weekend out there was).The moment my friend broke up with his GF, the first thing she did was to delete me.

&amp;#x200B;

Last year I ran into a local news article about a girl with serious health illness, I recongized her as one of the ""girls from the neighbourhood"" when we were kids. I sent her a friend request and she declined it. I messaged her anyways, saying how sorry I was to learn she was ill and wished her all the best. She replied thanking me.

I took a notice that my best friend had her as friends. I asked when was the last time they spoke on Facebook, he plainly said ""never"". So, she never had the problem having this guy from 12 years ago on her friends list that she never spoke to, but when I tried to comfort her she declined my request. 

&amp;#x200B;

My point is...How can I ever dream about having a girlfriend when regular every day people treat me this way. I'm trying to be polite and kind to everyone, but it seems I always end up that person when someone shows a funny meme/pet picture on their phone, they show it to all 9/10 people, but when my turn comes, they just close the phone.

ForeverAlone,"Hey there, FA fam! 
I rather often use this page rambling on about my not very successful love life as many of us do.
And I want to change our situation. 
So my plan is to create an International Datingapp that is completely free (without the mechanism to keep people as long as possible on it). I would love to create something like tinder but better and for free with an algorithm that shows others that are likely to swipe right and not ppl who are likely to dismiss your profile. 

The thing is I don't know shit about programming or building Apps. So if someone has any knowledge in this subject DM me.

I think it's sad that we have to pay for Dating apps subscriptions that then don't really shoes the ""perfect fit""

If an app doesn't work maybe I could set up a discort server and or a website but I think an app is the best way to get somewhere.

Ofcourse the app has to generate money so it could be promoted online that's why I would also search for either a sponsor or put in little ads but without making it to annoying bc I think everyone hates these frikin ads

ForeverAlone,"It's no secret that when people find you attractive, they tend to treat you kindly and are more considerate towards you. But ofcourse the other side of that is if you're ugly, nobody really cares about your existence, especially the opposite sex. If a girl finds you ugly, even going up to talk to her could ruin her day. If you ask her out and she finds you ugly, it's not unlikely that you're gonna be the story she's going to tell her friends about. On one hand she'll be offended, but on the other hand she'll also be flattered because you're another guy who finds her attractive (which feels good, ofcourse).

Unfortunately we have created a society where physical appearance is more important than the actual human being so I don't see this changing any time soon. It's the biggest mindfuck though; having people treating you differently purely based on how you look, even though you didn't choose to look that way.

ForeverAlone,"Heyhey so first things first: I'm your typical 18 years old, nerdy Weeb-Goth-Nonbinary Person.
I'm not exactly what you'd call decent-looking and I'm overweight.
So as you can imagine, I wasn't ever that popular. 

Recently, I ended my third relationship - and I know, it doesn't sound like I'm forever alone, but hear me out on this one.
In those three past relationships at least one part of the two of us, did it for the sake of not being alone or because we didn't fall for each other, but for the idea of falling for someone or in other words, we liked the idea of love itself, but each other not reallythat much.

In my second 'relationship' I was used to keep that affair she had with her best friend hot and spicy (you know like: 'my partner can't find out about this, so it feels dirtier') and as soon as I began to realise I was ghosted.

But here's the thing:
Even though I had a few relationships, there wasn't a single one, where at least the illusion of love could be kept up.
Not only that none of them worked out, but I realised that no matter in how many relationships I'd get, I'd never stop feeling lonely. This void in me, this loneliness, my flaws and my mental illnesses will most probably always be there, so really, there's absolutely no point in searching for a so called soulmate.
Relationships don't work out for me, because either I drive my partner mad or the other way around.
Love doesn't seem real to me anymore and I'm kinda glad I figured this out, before making yet another soul unhappy with a forced relationship.

So, to all out there:
I hope someday you'll find what you're looking for.
I really do.

But honestly, next time I feel like I need attention and a little love from another living being - I'm gonna get me a pet instead.

So would my goal be a family? The great evil in my mind, where souls are brought into this shit world only to suffer and die? Would my goal be regular sex? Sounds selfish to me, plus in that case escorts would be a better investment in time and energy. Would it be to have someone around with me?

I'm not entirely sure if this was simply me just being hyperaware of my surroundings or what but it seemed like the parents were a little weirded out that I was by myself based on the looks I was given and such. I would be standing there looking at whatever animal and just enjoying the sight and some little kid would come over near where I was to look too. Their parent would come rushing over and snatch the kid away from where I was standing. This happened atleast twice. I was watching the praire dogs (personal fave) and this little girl came running over. This kid was obviously not scarred of strangers because she was like ""I want to see!"" and did that arms up reaching thing. I was like uuuhhhh and started moving away looking around praying her parents would show up soon but she kept following me terrifying the hell out of me. Finally her mom showed up picked her up to see the praire dogs. 

Other than the run ins with the families it was a fine enough time. One of the people I asked to go with me but wasn't able to go sent me a message and asked if you had to wear a mask while there.

I can seperate three main things that concerned me for a . 

First of, I moved back to my parents house after an exciting life abroad, because I am still a student and finances aren't great. Finishing studies in two months, but I don't feel the excitement and joy I felt on my free time like I used to with my peers. Secondly, broke up with my girlfriend half a year ago. Haven't been with no one intimite since, which kinda bums me out often. Finally, I often feel week and lazy in my bones. As if there is no purpose or reason to keep myself pushing forward. The fear of it causes anxiety. 

It seems that I am depressed and downright miserable. As it is the case sometimes, It's not all that bad. There is a lot of good things going on that I feel grateful for. Just doesn't feel right at this point in my life. I figured why not ask someone here who's been in a similar position before and how you got your way out of your rut? Did it require grit or did it just take time? Maybe somebody feels the same way now?",How do you find content in everyday life?,Torbuttone

ForeverAlone,"Hello everyone

I've been lurking here on and off for some time now, (though a few might recall a DM I've sent their way), and I feel the need to express my thoughts on some of the common conversations that go on here. I can't be sure how this will be received, and you're welcome to react as you wish, but I want to be honest with you folks.

To disclose a tad, I'm a twenty something man, with an incredibly midling physique who only a few years since being overweight. I keep my hair long as well as an unkempt beard that makes me look 8 years older and makes people confuse me with anything between vape lounge residents to drug dealers (a person once walked up to me on the street, unprompted, to ask ""if I've got some on me right now""). I play video games for give or take 18 years as my primary time sink and recently I've spent plenty of time thinking about WWE (especially the recent Wrestlemania), having gone back to it. I study within the social sciences field. Despite my hobbies, I'm anything but masculine, as I'll hug anyone who lets me, and I call my mates ""dears"" and ""sweethearts"" at a whim. I dont drive and don't know a thing about cars, most DIY activities and chores (tho I can chop wood).

I'm also in a relationship, my first one, and I'm in it for some time now, though I've had my share of attempts and heartbreaks along the way, but more on that later.

I find people fascinating, and I try to extend love and respect to any (who are within bounds of decency). Maybe that's one of the reasons I'm attracted to this place, to observe others and maybe take something away from it, though I will also admit that I've grappled with FA feelings for a sizable amount of time, so a lot of what goes on here is not so foreign to me.

I'd like to say first of all that wanting a relationship is indeed okay. Certain people and communities will try to downplay the want and importance, and if those people feel that way, I think it's fine, but one should not be ashamed for something like that. I wanted a relationship since I was 16. That being said, I want folks here to hear me out on some things concerning relationships. The cuddling, finishing each other's sentences and what not is neat, but one should keep in mind that a relationship is a commitment unlike any other. You open yourself to another person in a way you wont to anyone else, and why it results in intimacy and other things we want, it also results in hardship. The honeymoon period of my relationship was filled carefree, as we're trying to feel each other out, but after that time, and we got more used to each other's company, the other parts of a relationship came around, namely, being there for another person, often in the form of phone calls in the dead of night because someone's anxiety is enroaching, having the other person be silent on you because someone is troubling them and you dont know what's going on, and trying to help them. Not to mention, tensions do indeed flare up, whether it's misunderstandings, clashes of personality or straight up deception, and which point one or both of us wonder if this relationship will still go on. It's getting rambly, but I want to point out that a relationship is not a Panacea. I dont want to imply that you have to be super enthusiastic and jumping of joy all the time to see yourself with a partner, but if you have issues with yourself, they wont simply be resolved because a person chooses to be with you. At this point, if you're deceitful about what sort of person you, it also shows. I still felt inadequacy over myself while within the relationship, for instance. And within the intimacy of a relationship,  your weaknesses and strengths as a person are made known to the other person, at which point you cant hide.

I've felt romantic feelings towards other people, many of which unsuccessful, but I tried to take away something from each. The first real crush I've had was for a girl in my class. We got on well, but talked rarely. Regardless, I've looked at her and dreamed of being together for many years (we ended up in the same university). She was aware of it through a mutual friend, as I later found out, but I cant be sure how that affected our interaction. And at one point she just left to a different place and nothing happened, so all that longing went for nothing for I didn't act. On the second go, I met a girl who I quickly fell for, once again, we got on pretty well, and I determined that I want a relationship with her. I started acting different, more suggestively, trying to give her hints that I'm interested in a relationship with her, but never pulled the trigger all the way down. Maybe she caught on, but our relationship quickly crumbled. I even tried to quasi-manipulate a girl into a relationship, as she was heartbroken and vulnerable (had a hard breakup in a long term relationship), and nearly killed our friendship because of it. I didn't hate those girls, they're cool, but I let my feelings for them get in the way of a natural relationship taking place, because on my mind I always had the idea that all of our interaction is a prelude to a relationship, and it would just ""happen"", but it never did. Though I tried to gain experience, I did experience FA feelings, and started accepting them, because it never worked out, and it seemed others have it so easy. As for who I now call my partner, we met randomly, and shared hobbies, and a relationship didn't occur to me, until feelings cropped up again, and after a bit of time, I decided to pull the trigger, win or lose, as I was not prepared to long at a person from a distance for years, hoping something just ""happens"". She shot me down, actually, because she didn't feel ready for a relationship, but we decided to carry our friendship on regardless, and after some more time, she started reciprocating and we decided to give this love thing a shot (and our results were outlined earlier).

I hope my personal experience showed you the sort of background I'm coming from. I want to emphasize - relationships are hard work, and they don't just ""happen"" - initiative must take place. You don't have to be a an 8 or a 9 or whatever (I despise this notation, it's dehumanizing), but you have to move towards opportunities. Dont expect the person to bear all of your emotional weight - you have to have peace in yourself and hold interest in life (whatever you're into) to be able to be with another. I know rejection sucks - I could fill playlists with all the songs I couldn't listen to because they reminded me of a girl I tried to fall in love with - and I know that others had harsher experiences, but if you believe in relationships and being with someone through whatever life tosses at you, it's all but a roadblock, not a wall. Don't disregard non-romantic relationships if you have them, because your friends and family matter a great deal - I wouldn't be where I am now if I didn't have a few friends who looked out for me, and helped me cope and supported my romantic endeavours. Don't feel pressured by friends, if you're having a rough go at relationships, as it breeds jealousy and endagers your relations.

If one person makes it through this wall, I'll be satisfied. If you feel that I'm wrong, or want a clarification or such, or just a conversation to hold you over (Roman Reigns should've lost), leave a comment, I'll be around to respond whenever, and I'll respond to the best of my ability.

ForeverAlone,"It's kinda fascinating and sad. Recently I learnt that Marmoset monkeys, after leaving their families, form these social groups where only one dominant male and dominant female gets to be in an intimate relationship. They will stay next to each other and have sex all the time. When other Marmoset monkeys in the group try to mate, even among themselves, they will be forcibly hurt by the dominant monkey of their own sex. Basically you're either having sex all the time or being a slave raising babies and finding food for the dominant couple. At least as humans we have the chance to mate with others on our level and don't have to pay directly for other people's children.",Most Marmoset Monkeys stay virgins for their whole lives,SuitableStart

ForeverAlone,"I know, pretty obvious right? But it's just crazy to me being at the state that I'm in rn to think about the fact that some people will for real never understand what it feels like to be this unfortunate in the dating game. I'm not talking about never being rejected because common sense tells us that we've all been there. I just feel like it's much MUCH easier for some to bounce back from said rejections because unlike some of us here they're not shit out of luck and actually have options. So no biggie really.

Now with this being as obvious of a fact as it is I wouldn't really have as much of a problem with this fact if some of these same people weren't condescending to those with no luck with girls with their ""obviously you're never gonna get anywhere if you don't put in the work""...the funny thing about this argument is there's a good chance the people they're addressing worked 10x hardee than they did to get theirs but are so convinced that it's lack of effort that fucks people over at the end of the day. For some people yes it does, but not everybody and I feel like that's what a good portion of people don't seem to understand. You don't always fail because you didn't try. Some of us out here put in the work day in and day out and still end up right back to square one, that's just how life is unfortunately in every aspect of success not just the dating game.

Now I know some people are gonna look at posts like these and go ""congrats, you figured out life is unfair to some and not others. What are you gonna do about it?"" well that's just the thing. What can a person in that predicament do besides work himself to the grave with the possibility of never seeing the ""fruits of thy labor"". The obvious solution is to keep pushing, but some of us have pushed for so long with no results it honestly feels like a waste of time. Coming to subs like this to bitch and vent is therapeutic because it feels good to get it off your chest every now and then and it's good to know you're not the only one suffering. Some lurkers here may not like it and take it as a use of meaningless complaining etc etc but honestly fuck those people and their condescending commentary. Let people express their frustration. It's cool to give advice so they don't stay here but don't demonize people for letting off some steam.

You can go on a ratings site and get rated by people, some will say yes your attractive, others will say no your not, and then some will say somewhat attractive.

Basically I‚Äôm like a 4/10 and very short, but I‚Äôm in good shape body-wise.

Anyway. I‚Äôve been on one date like 2 years ago from online dating. I was very nervous on the date because I had never dated before, so no shit I‚Äôm going to be nervous. She texted me and said she wasn‚Äôt romantically interested, which is fine. But that‚Äôs the extent of my dating history. That‚Äôs literally it. I‚Äôm 25 and that‚Äôs all I got. I‚Äôve tried relentlessly to do new shit, to meet new people. No luck. 

I‚Äôm an engineer at a major corporation and make very good money. Doesn‚Äôt matter though. No one cares. I slave away my life and come home to nothing. All I have are numbers growing in a savings acct with nothing to spend it on. But hey, at least I‚Äôll be able to afford a co-op soon, right?! So then I can be lonely AND a property owner!

I have been having dreams about girls being interested in me, in an innocent high school sort of way. Nothing sexual, just a genuine interest between me and a girl. The feeling of butterflies, excitement. That made me realize that I have never experienced this in real life. Nothing even close. No girl has ever ever ever shown interest in me. I‚Äôve never experienced true connection with anyone and, again, not even fucking close. 

I will likely be alone forever. It only gets worse as you get older. Women expect you in your late 20s into your 30s to have experience, to know how relationships work even if only at a rudimentary level. I know nothing. To know how to have sex, to please her. I am a 25 yo virgin, I don‚Äôt know anything. 

I pretty much give up on trying. It only cause emotional pain. The constant rejection from online dating apps, from meetups and at bars. I never had a chance. I just focus on my career, stacking cash, but I know it‚Äôs a meaningless pursuit, though it does provide a sense of progression and of moving forward. But the longing for a nice, sweet, caring woman who I can have a family with and share experiences with, that longing irks me still. 

In the age of social media, of tinder, of obsessions with appearance, I never stood a chance. From the moment I was conceived I was meant to be a cog in the machine; to produce and to keep my mouth shut, to enjoy my material wealth and to just be content with that alone, but of course it all means nothing without connection, belonging, feeling wanted, appreciated.

* Free (just email me to get verified if you don't want to pay $3)
* 10k+ members (50% are fully remote, 43% aspire to be)
* Balanced gender ratio - 56% women members
* No bots - all users are screened before they can match
* Beta - your feedback really counts here and we are constantly improving the app

This is my passion project and my day job is product management at a startup. I have a 2021 goal to turn this into my full time job. Previously I tried regular dating apps and noticed that where I lived had a huge impact on my dating experience/success. I'd be open to moving if it meant being with someone I love and this is my attempt to solve this.

ForeverAlone,"I never cared for personal media, I use it casually, mostly for the meme groups and stuff.

But I rarely ever get added as a friend. At my work, there is this guy who when you start working at the same place, he automatically searches you on Facebook and adds you. I was the only person not added by him, but I rather sent him the friend request. After a few months, he removed only me.

I'm not really active on FB, I don't post out of self esteem issues, but my coworkers aren't active as much either..

&amp;#x200B;

Some new guy joined the work, I had the pleasure with working with him on his first week, we befriended each other, he even told me he found me the coolest guy at work so far. Well, once he switched jobs, he removed only me, none of my other coworkers.

I had my friend get a girlfriend, one of those clingy types, I tried to make her welcome to our friend meets (since she couldn't let go of her BF for one night in the week). I had the feeling she hated me, since I was the devil pulling my best friend away from her (even tho she tagged along on every weekend out there was).The moment my friend broke up with his GF, the first thing she did was to delete me.

&amp;#x200B;

Last year I ran into a local news article about a girl with serious health illness, I recongized her as one of the ""girls from the neighbourhood"" when we were kids. I sent her a friend request and she declined it. I messaged her anyways, saying how sorry I was to learn she was ill and wished her all the best. She replied thanking me.

I took a notice that my best friend had her as friends. I asked when was the last time they spoke on Facebook, he plainly said ""never"". So, she never had the problem having this guy from 12 years ago on her friends list that she never spoke to, but when I tried to comfort her she declined my request. 

&amp;#x200B;

My point is...How can I ever dream about having a girlfriend when regular every day people treat me this way. I'm trying to be polite and kind to everyone, but it seems I always end up that person when someone shows a funny meme/pet picture on their phone, they show it to all 9/10 people, but when my turn comes, they just close the phone.

ForeverAlone,"Hey there, FA fam! 
I rather often use this page rambling on about my not very successful love life as many of us do.
And I want to change our situation. 
So my plan is to create an International Datingapp that is completely free (without the mechanism to keep people as long as possible on it). I would love to create something like tinder but better and for free with an algorithm that shows others that are likely to swipe right and not ppl who are likely to dismiss your profile. 

The thing is I don't know shit about programming or building Apps. So if someone has any knowledge in this subject DM me.

I think it's sad that we have to pay for Dating apps subscriptions that then don't really shoes the ""perfect fit""

If an app doesn't work maybe I could set up a discort server and or a website but I think an app is the best way to get somewhere.

Ofcourse the app has to generate money so it could be promoted online that's why I would also search for either a sponsor or put in little ads but without making it to annoying bc I think everyone hates these frikin ads

ForeverAlone,"It's no secret that when people find you attractive, they tend to treat you kindly and are more considerate towards you. But ofcourse the other side of that is if you're ugly, nobody really cares about your existence, especially the opposite sex. If a girl finds you ugly, even going up to talk to her could ruin her day. If you ask her out and she finds you ugly, it's not unlikely that you're gonna be the story she's going to tell her friends about. On one hand she'll be offended, but on the other hand she'll also be flattered because you're another guy who finds her attractive (which feels good, ofcourse).

Unfortunately we have created a society where physical appearance is more important than the actual human being so I don't see this changing any time soon. It's the biggest mindfuck though; having people treating you differently purely based on how you look, even though you didn't choose to look that way.

ForeverAlone,"Heyhey so first things first: I'm your typical 18 years old, nerdy Weeb-Goth-Nonbinary Person.
I'm not exactly what you'd call decent-looking and I'm overweight.
So as you can imagine, I wasn't ever that popular. 

Recently, I ended my third relationship - and I know, it doesn't sound like I'm forever alone, but hear me out on this one.
In those three past relationships at least one part of the two of us, did it for the sake of not being alone or because we didn't fall for each other, but for the idea of falling for someone or in other words, we liked the idea of love itself, but each other not reallythat much.

In my second 'relationship' I was used to keep that affair she had with her best friend hot and spicy (you know like: 'my partner can't find out about this, so it feels dirtier') and as soon as I began to realise I was ghosted.

But here's the thing:
Even though I had a few relationships, there wasn't a single one, where at least the illusion of love could be kept up.
Not only that none of them worked out, but I realised that no matter in how many relationships I'd get, I'd never stop feeling lonely. This void in me, this loneliness, my flaws and my mental illnesses will most probably always be there, so really, there's absolutely no point in searching for a so called soulmate.
Relationships don't work out for me, because either I drive my partner mad or the other way around.
Love doesn't seem real to me anymore and I'm kinda glad I figured this out, before making yet another soul unhappy with a forced relationship.

So, to all out there:
I hope someday you'll find what you're looking for.
I really do.

But honestly, next time I feel like I need attention and a little love from another living being - I'm gonna get me a pet instead.

So would my goal be a family? The great evil in my mind, where souls are brought into this shit world only to suffer and die? Would my goal be regular sex? Sounds selfish to me, plus in that case escorts would be a better investment in time and energy. Would it be to have someone around with me?

I'm not entirely sure if this was simply me just being hyperaware of my surroundings or what but it seemed like the parents were a little weirded out that I was by myself based on the looks I was given and such. I would be standing there looking at whatever animal and just enjoying the sight and some little kid would come over near where I was to look too. Their parent would come rushing over and snatch the kid away from where I was standing. This happened atleast twice. I was watching the praire dogs (personal fave) and this little girl came running over. This kid was obviously not scarred of strangers because she was like ""I want to see!"" and did that arms up reaching thing. I was like uuuhhhh and started moving away looking around praying her parents would show up soon but she kept following me terrifying the hell out of me. Finally her mom showed up picked her up to see the praire dogs. 

Other than the run ins with the families it was a fine enough time. One of the people I asked to go with me but wasn't able to go sent me a message and asked if you had to wear a mask while there. I told her yes and she said ""ok because I'm going monday"". That seemed a little annoying considering I asked her a week in advance and yet she changed her schedule to go monday instead of today with me. Oh well I guess.

ForeverAlone,"I told one of my best friends I liked them yesterday (I‚Äôm male, she‚Äôs female) and she looked uncomfortable as hell when I told her. 

I‚Äôm so upset. Not only does she not see me that way, the friendship is now changed forever.

‚Äî‚Äî-

I‚Äôm so jealous of people who actually love each other. Loving someone unconditionally and that being reciprocated is the greatest gift any one person can have in their life.

I‚Äôm a monster. Socially awkward. Can‚Äôt hold conversations with strangers. I‚Äôm also autistic. 

I fucking hate myself with every fiber of my being. I didn‚Äôt develop properly in a social sense and it‚Äôs destroyed my life. The one thing worth seeking in this life (love) seems so unattainable.

I‚Äôm almost 24 years old and am waiting to have my first kiss. This isn‚Äôt normal. I‚Äôm a freak and every single day is slow torture. Need my misery to end.",Can‚Äôt stop crying.,genericusername4724
ForeverAlone,"I'm 24 Y.o. and I kinda feel in a tough spot at the moment in my life and wanted to share it with this subreddit. Maybe someone might find it relatable and could provide some advise. 

I can seperate three main things that concerned me for a . 

First of, I moved back to my parents house after an exciting life abroad, because I am still a student and finances aren't great. Finishing studies in two months, but I don't feel the excitement and joy I felt on my free time like I used to with my peers. Secondly, broke up with my girlfriend half a year ago. Haven't been with no one intimite since, which kinda bums me out often. Finally, I often feel week and lazy in my bones. As if there is no purpose or reason to keep myself pushing forward. The fear of it causes anxiety. 

It seems that I am depressed and downright miserable. As it is the case sometimes, It's not all that bad. There is a lot of good things going on that I feel grateful for. Just doesn't feel right at this point in my life. I figured why not ask someone here who's been in a similar position before and how you got your way out of your rut? Did it require grit or did it just take time? Maybe somebody feels the same way now?",How do you find content in everyday life?,Torbuttone
ForeverAlone,"So.. about a month ago, I met someone... she even called me perfect...  Let's call her Sarah (not using real names).

Sarah and I seemed to be hitting it off, and we were talking EVERY day since we met.. we just have that much in common.. and even though Sarah lives a decent distance away.. she was interested in me!  I was happy.

Sarah and I started going on dates, and small adventures.. she met me half way to her place..  a few hour drive for both of us.. and we explored a ghost-town turned amusement park..  I had a blast with her, and she further expressed her intrest.. so we planned for me to drive to her place and spend a day or two there.

My car got wrecked, but I managed to get there anyways..  I spent the weekend with her, and I had a lot of fun with her.. and she continued to show intrest in me.. and I felt like we were getting closer...  we started sitting closer, and holding each other..

Nothing was wrong..  until.

She told me, on that Sunday, that her friend was going to be there.  She wanted us to meet.  We'll call her friend Mary.  

Mary was reluctant to come over.  Mary refuses to meet me.  She wants no part in it.  Sarah explains to me that Mary is possessive...  and I get quiet.. and I'm not sure what to think.  I asked Sarah if she wanted me to leave, so Mary would be comfortable to go over, since Sarah was upset that Mary didn't want to go..

Sarah ensures me that no, she didn't want me to leave yet.. ( I was leaving later that day anyways)  and that Mary would get over it and come around.



I leave.  I get home.  Sarah and I text and call and chat and say how much fun we have, and plan for her to come visit me the very next weekend.

Fast forward to later in the week..

Sarah texts me.. asking if we can talk.  Something is wrong.

She tells me that Mary came out to her on Sunday.  She told me that Mary wants to be with her... she seems so confused... and I'm confused.  I don't think she's sure.. but I think she'd rather be with Mary than me..  but she seems so unsure... even though she's already thought about it for a week.

Sunday she told her..
Tuesday, we planned for her to visit me..
Thursday she told me.


I feel like officially giving up, but at least I managed to make it this far :/.  I know I'm not perfect, and I told her that as soon as I met her... but I don't feel like I deserve this.",I thought I've left this place,some1uused2know

ForeverAlone,"Today's my day off work so I hung out with my mother like one with no friends does. We went to the movies then Walmart for groceries. I had to get batteries but dropped and accidentally broke a pack. When I gathered the scattered pack to hand to an employee, her first words were ""You're so pretty!"" Of course I panicked and mumbles thanks before handing the batteries over to her.

Even if she was just saying it, this meant sooo much because I usually feel extremely gross about my looks, and my period is making me bloated and nauseous but she still complimented me.

To top it off, when I was scanning my items I could hear the same person telling another employee to look at me because she thought I was pretty. The second employee agreed and even said she liked my outfit.

Not really a success story but I'll probably replay this mentally for weeks like a weirdo",A Small Glimpse of Hope,E-Scope
ForeverAlone,"I been looking at personals and thinking like, younger me would say no, but current me would entertain the idea. I'm tall (doesn't help btw, at least not for this), I'm chubby (but I'm eating well now), but all and all I'm alright. But looks aren't why I feel its hard to find someone no no no (land before time reference)

The issue is I'm with someone (screams) I get it it's a poly relationship right and I looked at that page and it seems so new sex partner kinda community. I'm demisexual,  I tried the hookup thing, but I couldn't go through with it. There were signs my whole life, but I figured it out. Anyways,  I hate it because it puts me in a hard spot. Younger me would be like no. 

(Noones forcing you to do it) technically no one is, besides my biology eventually pushing at me. My gf got cancer years ago and we can't be together like that.  It hurts my heart I feel horrible.  I'm not a cheater. Everything about this feels wrong.  It hurts, and I need a relationship if this is gonna work. I can't do what normal people do. But I can't think that anybody would be okay with this. I never felt depressed like I am now because I feel like a bad person. 

I kept trying. I'm more cis than bi, but whatever,  I met this guy earlier this year and it seemed fine,  but then he started messaging every other day barely saying much. He just said I'm just busy and I never touche my phone. Let's say thats true. Wtf. I just wanna have someone I'm actually with. I know its a ldr but still. I don't like the dating world. I love consistency. I don't ask for much.  Being there is a must. The thing is, I would have said no to me too.

The only person that was fine with it seems to stringing me along. The thing is maybe he really is busy. Its not like he's walking all over me, but that's not normal right.

See i can't understand people thinking they can't find dates because they're ugly,  because not everyone is pretty so finding someone shouldn't be too bad. Also if you're socially awkward,  because so many of us are now. But this kinda thing. People want to feel loved and I get that so much man. Also they wanna feel like the most important so how is this fair. While in my mind I can see them as just as important. It wouldn't be effortless for them,  i don't think.

Doesn't help that my love language is quality time

I might delete this. I'm not religious but I grew up religious and I can't be stop feeling guilty. She says to go out there like its easy for me but I grew up faithful for a reason. It's not like I'm super picky or anything,  but I feel like I can't be choosing with my wants if I try.

I'm chubby,  but I lost weight. I don't want to go back. I don't need a thin stick,  but healthy eating is what I do now. I feel like normally you can have healthy expectations.  Not like be 6'3 with gaint tits, but normal stuff like be a creative.

ForeverAlone,"25y.o. I don't have any goals. Just an highschool graduate. I have my license but i despise driving and not very good at it. All i see myself and have been doing is wage slave jobs like warehouse work and even there I struggle to find anything. I've applied to a bunch of jobs related to it after my last one and got rejected. Lmao. What do I do. Even if I do get work it's temporary. I wish I was motivated to put myself out there but im just not. I don't have any interests besides football. it's the only talent i have. All i see ahead is suicide and i swear i would've get it done if that was easy. Education is just not for me. idk, social anxiety, i struggle to pay attention, just low iq. Or maybe it's just my insecurities. Im aware of situations and i know exactly what is wrong with me, my life or what people think, even though they usually think less. Shyness ends me. I just don't find the motivation. When it comes to girls well, I've lost a few opportunities to be happy bc i didn't just go for it. Others, well, i out them off.  Only one i actually had something going i met her on twitter last year and i genuinely had her under my control for months of just talking. (Please don't think im c*nt.) She had and has a rich, good looking 6'4 boyfriend. Far above me. But she was my friend and i knew i could make her want more. And i did. Met up w her when she came to my country on vacation, made out with her but ofc i ended messing up and didn't escalate the situation when i should've. She became the one under control.  Downhill from there. She left after 2 weeks. Many arguments while she was here and after, more than ever before, and even tho i had her still all over me at certain times after she left, with her saying she wanted to do ""it"" next time. That i made her realize her alot about her relationship and her being unhappy. Unfortunately, our friendship (whatever it was)  just didn't last long enough. Going back n forth w our friendship, and now, 6 months later of talking, it seems that it's completely over. She stopped talking to me. Says she has stuff to fix irl and will come back on social media later, thou i see her playing Uno so many times. Seems she lost interest and im trying by best to not show desperation. We were never going to be a thing and i didn't want that either. Not the type of girl u want one fkn bit. Good person, but lots of anger issues. But it still hurts. I wanted to keep our thing going when she came on vacation since i do like her, and a friendship when she's not here. Seems that it won't be like that. I don't want her like that, but she does make me more motivated when she's talking to me. Think it's time to let go.

I still got in trouble and yelled at by my mom for it. so now I don't feel comfortable telling my friends anything cuz there's a very likely chance they will tell someone and I would get in trouble so I started talking to people in random chats like Omegle (btw Omegle is not just random facetime It also has a chat thing) cuz I trusted them and they would never tell and I could never get in trouble cuz they don't know me.",why is it so hard to make friends?,TEM12345678
ForeverAlone,"Whenever normal people speak of rejection they always seem to think that the only thing that qualifies as rejection is getting a 'no' to the question ""Do you want to go out with me?"".  

But in reality rejection is so much more. It's getting only one-word answers and a body language that screams ""leave me alone"" when you talk to a girl at a party, it's never being swiped right on a dating app, it's never having a girl initiate conversation, it's never even having a girl have eye contact with you.

ForeverAlone,"This was a weird situation. I was sleeping peacefully for several weeks. I am alone and usually just deal. But I had a dream last night where I was consulting with my mom and sister telling them the obvious. I‚Äôm alone and have no friends. And I don‚Äôt have anyone lining up to date me.

Now, the reality isn‚Äôt what‚Äôs disturbing. It‚Äôs the fact that my loneliness is following me in my sleep. The dream had no remedy nor was it anything positive. I was just pathetically sitting in a chair letting my semi-toxic family know I‚Äôm a loner. 

The end of the dream. Almost like I‚Äôm being harassed in my sleep for my lonely state in life that is out of my control. 

I woke up kind of disturbed and feel a bit sad. Sleep was always a reward for enduring a hard day. Or an emotionally challenging day. Ugh...maybe sleep is overrated and I just gotta spend a lot of time binge watching shows or playing video games. I tend to be happier awake anyhow.

ForeverAlone,I've read a number of articles about how chronic loneliness decreases someone's life expectancy. It gives the number of reasons of what loneliness does to the body and that it is as bad as smoking 15 cigerettes a day. Nowhere have I read the  average number of years someone is expected to live with this. I'm sure there are just too many variables to consider and a lack of formal study on it but I was curious if anyone had read an expected number of years.,Does anyone know?,whatever2340
ForeverAlone," 

I know there are new rules, just so you know, I prefer PMs directly. I also prefer completely anonymous chats, so no need to tell each other what gender or ethnicity we are, or share what we look like, definitely no pics. I feel like my best friendships on here have been anonymous and i'd like to keep that going.

The social starvation is real, so is the isolation. To be clear, I am looking for platonic friendships, i freak out hard whenever people try to be romantic or flirtatious, and i usually end up ghosting afterwards. Generally I love talking to people all around the world, but i think it's just started to depress me when you get like really close to someone on the opposite side of the globe and then it fizzles out eventually from a couple months to a year later. I'd like to meet someone who is near Toronto so that, in addition to being able to do stuff virtually, maybe we could meet up when the world is less crazy.

I love making people laugh. I love having hour long phone calls about random weird things and memes. I love writing stories, fantasies specifically. I love horror movies and romcoms, especially bad ones, because it's fun to make fun of the things people thought would be scary or romantic - and just aren't. I like listening to people's problems and understanding the little nuances in the way they think, and connecting things in their present to things they told me about their past - I like seeing the characters in people. I like playing the ukulele, and I secretly enjoy karaoke, and even more secretly would love to learn how to dance.

I prefer long messages, and I probably won't respond to short ones that just ask how i'm doing, or what i'm up to. I think I'm here because I am just so socially starved, I feel like I'm the person always reaching out to people, and trying to make plans or things work and it just never does? Which makes me feel like i don't have friends - and sometimes it's like so bad that just talking to someone in an elevator, or talking to someone on the subway is enough to give me a random jolt of existance before it dwindles and i'm just back where i was before. I'm very lucky to have gotten a job recently, and it's nice to be able to talk to clients when they come in, but there's always that sense of *other*ness that I feel.

But tell me about you. Tell me what you do in your spare time, how you've been staying sane during all of this. Tell me what's on your bucket list, tell me what you were like in highschool and how much you've changed since, tell me a crazy story about you - if it helps, maybe we could do it like through two truths one lie.

ForeverAlone,"I honestly don‚Äôt know how I manage to avoid it in general, but it‚Äôs settling back in now. That feeling of me realizing that I‚Äôll never find happiness, a conclusion I come to simply by assessing my situation. Is it completely based in truth? Who knows, but it sure as hell feels like it. Since last night I‚Äôve realized just how little I have going for me right now, and what‚Äôs scary is I don‚Äôt know how it can possibly change. 

I have no friends, which doesn‚Äôt bother me as much as it used to since I‚Äôve come to realize that it‚Äôs not necessarily because I‚Äôm not good enough to socialize, I‚Äôm just different from everyone. My social skills aren‚Äôt bad, I just don‚Äôt connect with people enough for me to hang out with them. Which is all a damn shame since having no friends increases the difficulty of every other aspect of my life. There‚Äôs nothing more demoralizing than seeing post after post of women answering the question ‚Äúwould you date a guy with zero friends?‚Äù with ‚Äúno, that‚Äôs a huge red flag for me, I don‚Äôt want a guy who‚Äôs clingy‚Äù and so on. Which I understand. Honestly I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm clingy, in fact most of the time I‚Äôm quite the opposite. I‚Äôll admit I definitely used to have a clingy side to my personality, but that died along with my innocence, and also when I realized that people are pretty overrated and aren‚Äôt worth clinging on to. But because I‚Äôm a human being and given my biochemistry, I‚Äôm programmed to seek validation from people and I‚Äôm programmed to feel like shit when I have no friends and nobody in my life. I wish it would just stop there, but nope the reality of not having friends also makes me less dateable. The rich get richer and the poor get poorer. I understand I‚Äôm only focusing on the negative and there are women out there who wouldn‚Äôt care if I don‚Äôt have friends and so on and whatever, but imma be negative for now because depression (that is evidently very treatment-resistant). 

I‚Äôm working on my self-esteem I swear, and I feel like some progress has been made. But it‚Äôs a war between me and natural selection, as I struggle to shed the traits that make me less desirable to women in an attempt to prove that I do have biological value and purpose and my genes are worth being passed down (that last part I actually don‚Äôt care about too much since there‚Äôs no way I‚Äôm spawning children, it‚Äôs just more of a validation thing). That being said when I do things I do them for myself, don‚Äôt get it twisted. It‚Äôs just that whenever I do things solely for my own well-being, I‚Äôve realized deep down I‚Äôm always indirectly doing it because I believe any direction toward self-improvement will help me attain what I really want in life: friends who I actually connect with and a romantic partner. And there‚Äôs no way for me to remove that remove that piece of my motivation, it‚Äôs built into me, it‚Äôs built into everyone. We all seek external validation, in the end that‚Äôs what everybody is trying to achieve, no matter how much we emphasize the importance of self-improvement, which can be helpful but on its own it can only take me so far. 

So yeah I‚Äôm just marinating in that overwhelming feeling of me realizing that I‚Äôll probably never have friends due to emotional incompatibility with everyone, which in turn means I‚Äôll probably never reach a mutual attraction with any woman. Which also sucks the purpose out of my life and removes my drive to do most things, knowing the only reason I‚Äôm keeping myself somewhat busy is because doing nothing everyday would drive me nuts, but I also know whatever I‚Äôm doing with my life for the sake of finding purpose or improving myself is all fake since I‚Äôll never find anyone to improve myself for. I‚Äôve extracted damn near all the internal validation and motivation I could possibly muster, and now I‚Äôm just stuck. I need another fuel source, I just don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever get it. 

I need to talk to someone who actually fucking understands. Doesn‚Äôt mean I should or will, but I definitely need to. I‚Äôm always hesitant about the idea of making friends on this sub since who knows where the fuck we all are emotionally and so many things could easily go wrong, but dammit that doesn‚Äôt stop me from wanting to talk to people who will actually understand me and then gathering 3 or 4 of these people and building a Minecraft world with them. And before you judge me for being so specific, don‚Äôt tell me when you were a child you never fantasized about having a few close friends (instead of zero) and playing something like Mario Party with them over the weekends rather than rotting alone in your bedroom.

ForeverAlone,"I have always felt incomplete without a boyfriend. Recently, without even trying, I‚Äôve felt complete just with myself. I don‚Äôt know if this will last forever because it feels really nice right now.

ForeverAlone,"  Just another display at my pathetic attempt at finding a girlfriend. Not surprising , the online dating was a bust but I wasn‚Äôt too optimistic on that one. I finally got a friend to take pity on me and tried to take on the challenge to promote me. She took my profile picture from my facebook and used that to send out to a bunch of people apparently. If I had been actually attractive I would have gotten some interest almost immediately if not by the end of the day. It has been 3 days and I have not heard from my friend on any updates about this latest endeavor. I was complaining to them that I couldn‚Äôt find anyone and had asked this friend previously if they had known anyone. When I brought it up again she said that she didn‚Äôt want to ‚Äúput my business‚Äù out there. I can‚Äôt help but interpret that the reason she didn‚Äôt do it initially is that she suspected that the results I would get is what is actually happening now. She probably could guess that nobody would be interested and would be slightly embarrassed that she even put me out there as a potential for someone. Super sucks. This was my last real opportunity I could see finding someone that didn‚Äôt rely solely on luck by bumping into someone randomly.",Not sure why I even try anymore,whatever2340
ForeverAlone,"Obviously I'm mediocre at talking and bonding with girls since I'm in this sub. But also at making friends in general. After primary school almost all my friends went to other schools, but I still had 1 who's still a friend today even if we haven't talked either in person, called or texted in over a year. I'm sure we'll see each other again after covid. In university I guess I got lucky finding some friends through volunteering for stuff, but it has always remained clear I'm disposable. 

I'm  mediocre at sports. Back in high school I was the fat kid so always chosen last of course. A year ago when the lockdown started I started cycling and a year later you'd think I have made lots of progress, but meh. I can do larger distances, hills are easier but I'm barely faster than when I started. Also in the past it's been clear it takes an eternity for my endurance and condition to get to a good level while others can be where I'm now after like 2 or 3 months.

I'm mediocre at studying and working. I'm in my final year studying for a STEM degree. I know my grades will be ok at best because all I can do is doing what I'm told, I don't bring any new ideas to the table, I'm not 'inventive' enough so as a scientist obviously that's not too good for your grades.

I'm mediocre at learning new skills. Again during the lockdown last year I decided to teach myself some new card games, board games, chess playing online with real people but a year later I still make rookie mistakes. For other things I lack patience or like I just said I simply do not get better at it whatever I do.

I feel like I can't do anything good. I don't want to blame my parents but sometimes I feel like I can't do otherwise. But where did it go wrong? I don't understand. Except dad losing his temper sometimes be it for not understanding the math homework or breaking something, but that happens to everyone I guess and most people turn out fine. I guess because I got raised a fat kid making me unpopular, neglected. I'm kind of in better shape now but I don't think the burden of anxiety and shyness will go away soon.",Is anyone else also just mediocre at everything?,JimmySaulGene
ForeverAlone,"My life is basically ruined because of the fact that I'm a 5'5"" man. Almost all of society views short men as subhumans, even people who claim to stand for social-justice think nothing of height-shaming and will defend every instance of it. Whenever I complain, I always get gaslit for not being ""confident"" enough, or I get told that some celebrity from the 80's was short then I should have no problem being social. If you're a confident short man then everyone just think you're annoying.

People go out of their way to ignore me in social situations so it's nearly impossible to make friends and I've never been in a relationship that wasn't online-only. Because I don't have a social life, I have no motivation to find a career-path so I live with my parents and work a shitty part-time job even though I know I could have done much more in life if I had a better college experience.",My height literally makes it impossible for me to live a normal life,BlindLeadsBlinder
ForeverAlone,"I'm 27, F, and have never been in a real relationship. I have ASD, ADHD, depression, severe anxiety, tokophobia, and shut down when I get too stressed.

My father, as much as I despise the bastard, has still managed to scare me by abandoning me repeatedly throughout my life. Last time he called was to finally pay the arrears he owed because he couldn't collect on an insurance payout until he did. Managed it in one payment. Turns out he could all along, he just didn't care to help support me and kept moving around so the courts would have to track him down again.

In 4th grade, my mom reached her breaking point with my out-of-control behavior (pre-ASD diagnosis) that I ended up an outpatient (while mom was at work) at a children's psychiatric ""hospital."" Truth is, they did absolutely nothing to help me, and when I inevitably lashed out, I was dragged up to the ""quiet room"" where I had heard other kids in my room screaming in terror. When I resisted because of that, I suffered a ""therapeutic hold"" which in reality was a potentially-fatal restraint method where I was pinned facedown on the floor by 2-3 grown-ass adults who completely immobilized my movements and were content to ignore me as a screamed, cried, and begged me to stop. Once I was close to passing out and too exhausted, they left me in that empty white room alone where all I could do was pace and worry that I'll be forgotten in there. When I was discharged, I walked out of there with trauma I never spoke of until years later, a pacing habit, and my aversion to touch had presented itself along with claustrophobia when someone wants to keep hugging me even after I'm done with it.

In middle school, I was bullied. A boy prevented me from closing my locker and tried to go through everything in there, a pair of girls kept trying to trip me down the stairs, a boy threatened to shoot my dog because he knew she was a fence-jumper (I got in trouble for ""disrupting the class"" when I immediately told the teacher), others kept using my misophonia to try to get reactions out of me to get me punished, and some even threw things at me (chewed up eraser pieces, half-eaten burgers and sandwiches, rocks, a ketchup packet that nearly scratched my cornea, etc.). School left me hanging out to dry, telling me to ignore them (didn't work; they just escalated) and ""If we didn't see it, there's nothing we can do about it"" and all that bullshit. I even got in trouble because a pair of girls who decided they didn't like me for some reason falsely accused me of calling them the N word after I'd ignored all their previous insults (""You chew like a cow"" and ""Someone needs to get a bag to hide for face"" being a couple of them). By that point, I didn't feel like there was any point in standing up for myself and accepted the punishment of making a poster detailing why racism is wrong where it would be hung up (with my name on it) for all to see.

By the end of middle school, depression had made itself thoroughly at home and my self-esteem was destroyed.

In high school, my cousin died at 19. In recent years, he'd pulled away from the entire family (including me, who idolized him and viewed him like a favorite older sibling when I was really young). I felt a bit of abandonment there too. He'd never been mean to me. He just grew distant. I kept wanting to reconnect with him, but I kept chickening out and thinking ""next time."" He passed away before I could. That feeling of abandonment turned to regret and anger toward his mother and our grandfather when I discovered that the him I used to know still existed around his friends. Our stupid, narcissistic grandfather and snapped at him one day and essentially told him, ""Shut up, you're annoying."" And his equally narcissistic mother was ashamed of him because of his tattoos and the fact that he'd dropped out of high school. He'd gotten his GED, but she still ragged on him about it and forced him to hide his tattoos around family. She wanted him to fit the perfect box she'd set up for him. The family fell apart after that. The only ones I still talk to are my mother and grandmother (who divorced narcissistic grandfather). Got a lot of fucked up emotions there.

At the end of high school, I wasn't needing medication for ADHD anymore, so I stopped taking it (with doc's approval). Problem was that I didn't know it also directly affected my metabolism. On top of not changing my daily habits, my metabolism was briefly thrown out of whack. I quickly put on weight.

By college, I thought I found a guy who actually liked me. We kissed. But he turned out to be a player who still let other girls sit on his lap. I regret letting him have my first kiss.

A couple years after that, a guy actually asked me out for dinner. It was late by the time he got off work, so nothing fancy was left open. He never brought up the issue again, never talked about that dinner, and slowly just stopped talking to me.

I flew into a depressive spiral so hard that my weight gain increased.

I've been in therapy again for almost a year. I'm improving with my assertiveness, but my self-esteem isn't budging up. It feels like it's dead and I'm beating on it expecting something to happen. I still look in the mirror and all I see is a fat, ugly woman with no redeeming qualities. Exercise hurts and my brain says I'm not worth the effort. I'm shit at taking compliments because I feel like I don't deserve it. All my friends are in healthy relationships and some are even married. And I'm just sitting here wondering where the fuck I'm even going in life. I have no direction, nothing I want to do besides things that allow me to mentally escape for a while, and my irl social life has been nonexistent for years. I've discovered I have tokophobia, but then I laugh at myself because the chances of anyone even wanting to be intimate with me seem like zero so I don't have to worry about falling pregnant or even using birth control.

In the rare occasions I try to write again, any attempt at writing romance becomes the main character being as fucking insecure as I am that, even when someone does show up who wants them, it never goes away. And that's where I get stuck because it always ends with that person getting sick of MC and walking away. I always end up projecting my emotions and fears into it. On the rare occasion that the ending I imagine turns out happy, I end up crying because I'm afraid I'll never experience anything like that. The story turns too painful for me to write and it gets tossed.

In short, I feel like I have nothing, and I don't have the confidence or drive to go out and fix my shit. I'm stuck, and it fucking hurts. I don't want to die and I'm not suicidal, but I don't see the point in living anymore.","(Long Rant) I'm not sure if my therapist can help me.

ForeverAlone,"So basically for the past 6 months I‚Äôve been texting this girl Marissa (not real name but used for all intents and purposes). We met at this church youth group but didn‚Äôt really get close until recently. I had asked her on a date and surprising said yes but due to scheduling conflicts it never came to fruition. Anywho, we still snapped and texted everyday and even FaceTimed once where we both fell asleep on call. I thought finally! Finally I can escape this decrepit hole of loneliness. 

But I was sorely mistaken.

Today, she asked if she can vent to me. Since I‚Äôm not a dick, I said yes, you can vent. She then proceeded to go on a tirade directed towards this one boy she wants to be with. She mentioned how they‚Äôve been on two dates and even kissed once but he never snaps her unless she initiated and didn‚Äôt know what to do. Admittedly, I was taken aback by this. I then helped her by giving my opinion in an unbiased way. Afterwards, as I‚Äôm writing this, I‚Äôm teary-eyed and just mad. Like I get that it‚Äôs not the end of the world but I‚Äôm just frustrated. Like how come everyone else around me are social butterflies and can get partners regardless? I‚Äôm the only one in my friend group who‚Äôs single or inactive. I‚Äôm sad. 

atleast I‚Äôm not a total dick.

Despite the fact I‚Äôve essentially been friend-zoned by Marissa, I‚Äôm still going to help her through her endeavor. I‚Äôm not just gonna drop her as she doesn‚Äôt wanna go down the avenue of romance. I‚Äôm just not like that. The hardest part is going to conceal my feelings towards the situation.

I want sex all the time, the thought of someone having sex with me is revolting. But what really pisses me off is this curse of only wanting someone that is unavailable. For instance let's say I meet someone, if I find them attractive there is a 95 percent chance they are not available whether from being engaged, lesbian, asexual, or ya know just not interested which of course is also valid. The kicker is though that if we do jive well and I think they're great I will almost never make a move because well I'm fucking stupid. So they eventually just become friends and I never really think about it too much because after someone knows me long enough I kind of lose any romantic interest. Well with three exceptions but once again only because those three are and will remain unavailable lmao.

&gt;*I don't want to live like this, Lord*  
*I don't want to live at all*  
*I don't want to make this face anymore*  
*But if I don't, that's all*

I woke up, already angry. Let the shitshow begin. Usual birthday wishes from my family, wishing me to find a girl because my parents want grandchildren. Guess what? That's not gonna happen. I don't even know if I should even be mad, if they didn't put effort for raising me as a capable human being, why would I care about dissapointing them? My parents were always there for me, but what they failed at, was raising a man. They raised an obese no-life, a quitter, a failure. Sure, I am responsible for myself, I fight the bad habits, I try to loose fucking weight, hell, maybe I will even be able to fix my teeth when I get a job. Too bad I can no longer go to the gym and my life is revolving around constant physical pain because of my fucked up back, that 2 surgeries couldn't fix and If it still won't get better I will probably get another one that doesn't guarantee anything at all. 3 years of constant pain that made me drop out of my masters degree and quit my job, took the pleasure of playing board and card games with my friends because I can't sit due to pain, well, shit happens, such is life.. But enough of it, just a little background.

&gt;*And want is not a need*  
*Reserved for human beings*  
*It's fingers on your throat*  
*Is pain that all things know*

It's my birthday after all, so I decided to have some fun. Masturbated 4 times in a row with a naive hope that I won't think about sex and intimacy for the rest of the day. Well, too bad. Loneliness hits even harder. Decided to go for a walk, I put some of my favourite sad music for a gray, cold day. Returned with tears in my eyes. Yeah, that's my celebration of getting older, laying in my bed and crying. Pathethic, a grown man crying into his pillow.

&gt;*What point is there in pushing on*  
*When all you push against is a brick wall?*

Oh, I posted here earlier and since then I tried to go to a therapy, I visited a psychologist for a month and decided to quit. After every visit I was just more sad and angry, I don't know why. All she told was that maybe I am too harsh for myself. Well, nice waste of money. I don't know, maybe I should look for another one.

&gt;*I don't want to feel this anymore*  
*But if I don't, that's fake*  
*I don't want to do this anymore*  
*But there's nothing else to take*

It's evening now and I am drinking my second bottle of wine after 4 months of abstinance, also smoked half a pack of cigarettes after a year of not smoking. Fun times. Thinking about sex and intimacy agian. Fantasizing about hugs, but it's not for disgusting things like me. Story time. I'm so lonely and desperate I once went with my friends to a strip club after a night of drinking, inside even more alcohol, one of the dancers sat next to me and I lost my fucking my mind. I went for a dance, also I'm a foot fetishist and she was oaky with it, so I basically paid 1000$ for licking a strippers feet, drunk out of my mind, I don't even know how I was able to return home and I probably insulted lots of girls there after realizing what I have done... Don't remember much more from that night. I don't know why I am writing this, maybe I need to confess somewhere, it was like 3 or 4 years ago. I thought I would be a better man after hitting 25, but nothing changed. Maybe I am just one of those guys whose only contact with a woman will be by paying them. I am looking for a job now as my savings are thawing. Maybe that's the way to go, If I can't be a normal person, I should just pay the girls for girlfriend experience. Not everyone must be successful in this life and it seems I'm in the looser section. Maybe that's the way to go, hookers, alcohol and maybe drugs, always wanted to try some of them and opiates would definitely help with physical pain. If the reality is unbearable while sober, what is the point?

I don't really have a problem with life being meaningless, but I would atleast want to have some fun on this fucking world. And what do I have now? Self-hared, possible wage-slaving and depression. Way to fucking go. I always wanted to travel and see the world, but now I am unable to sit for a long periods of time and, well, my job is also sitting. Ironic.

And after writing all of this, I don't know If I am still that sad, maybe more like, I don't know, empty? Definitely not happy. I wish I was atleast talent at some arts to better express my self, maybe even earning money for vomiting my soul to the public. I am definitely too dumb for academical pursuits, too disgusting and clueless for a hedonistic life of hooking up. My body is too weak for sports. Hell, I was even bad at stupid gaming. I don't know what else to write, probably no one will read it anyway. I will just end it all with another quoute from one of my favourite songs because I am pretentious like that. I wish I had a good personality, but I guess people like me are just fucked up on all sides of life. I don't even have hobbies that would help me meet women or make me an intresting person, a worthy human being, too fucking bad. Well, I still have some of the wind, some pizza and will probably masturbate again before going to sleep.

my department in the hallway talking to the boss. I finished dumping my trash and I see her blocking my only exit with a cart, the boss nowhere in sight. Ofc this was all on purpose, she was slowly bending down, her ass facing me. She looks back at me as I approach, flips her hair, slowly picking items up. There was maybe 7 items total on the cart lol. She then says to me ""no need to be in a hurry, you get paid by the hour"". I laugh and say ""yeah that's true"". We talk a little bit, while she's still showing herself off. She gets quiet and at this point I'm getting nervous and my glasses start to fog up.

ForeverAlone,"I want a best friend. Man or woman idc. Just be 23-30 ideally. +/- one or two years from that is okay. 

I'm a dreamer, I like to fantasize about what for me seems to be impossible lately. 
I'm in search of a long-term friendship for someone that is similar to me. 

One where we share some similar interests. That we aren't there to drag each other down or just listen to sad talk all the time. (That shit gets tiring) every once in a while it's okay to vent for everyone of course.


I'd love to have a friend I could talk to all the time, no matter what time of the day it is. And the same would go for them of course. 

The ideal friend I'm Searching for should share 3+ or more of my interest/important personality traits or ideas I share. 

Here's some stuff about me. If you relate to 3 or more let's be friends. 

* Not easily offended. Meaning witty banter between each other is okay. It's not to trash talk each other, but taking everything seriously nah. 
*Like friends (the series)
*Likes the walking dead
*Breaking bad
*Speaks English/Danish (I am from Denmark but you can be from anywhere in the world. As long as we can communicate)
*Hearthstone (the game)
*Chess rush (the game online/app)
* Arvil Lavigne 
*Dua lipa
*Drake
*Debating about things going on in the world
*Memes
*Comics (like webtoon) 
*Working out / fitness health 
*Anime
*Loyal
*Honesty
*Empathy
*Fluent in sarcasm 
*Less fluent in trash talking (I think banter is fun, if it's harmless. But also the other person shouldn't take every single witty thing or banter so serious they're easily offended like I said earlier)


Ability to hold a conversation equally is important for me. (Yes a natural flow is important and it's great and all. But at the end of the day if it's just one person doing all the work in the conversation and there to ""entertain the other"" I have better shit to do than that.) 

I'd like for someone who is genuinely interested in investing time and effort into the friendship as long as both parties do. 

Do I not seem like the type of friend you want. By all means don't contact me. You definitely have the right not to do so of course. 

Should I peak your interest and you wanna be friends with me. By all means too. Definitely hit me up and we will be awesome friends together. 

Feel free to message me, (or don't) if you want. 

I understand that for some people a best friend is build up over years and years of time. This isn't to discuss what a real friend is, what it means all of that. It's more me being lonely and wanting a friendship that last. And if you can relate to the way I feel you can message me, and if it doesn't click with you and none of the stuff I said make sense you can just not contact me. It's simple. 

Cheers and have fun everyone.",24 M forever alone only have one family member I talk to. Need a long term friend. M Or F idc.,Useful_Use

ForeverAlone,"Hello, so I'm 24 and I've been doing some thinking, and my life has been nothing but misfortune. Although I've always been a very positive person, like I really try. I try to be honest, I make others laugh, I inspire others... But I feel like life just keeps getting harder for me.

Coming into this world, I was immediately raped by my own brother. Innocence gone.

Then I grew up in a toxic environment, strict, alcoholic father. And my mother cuddled me a lot.

I was bullied tons in school. My own kindergarten teacher had a grudge with my father and smacked me in the face for no reason. I was just a kid. 

Fast-forward to now, I am 24, working in a warehouse with a college degree, balding, taking drugs that alter my hormones and give me side effects.

I shaved my head and find out it looks like alien brains (CVG) 

My current friends make fun of me, and are super toxic, untrustworthy. Except for one.

I try self-help, all kinds of books. It feels good for a while, but my reality doesn't change. 

I slave myself every day, to pay bills. To live a life that I am unhappy with.

I try to look at the positive side of the world, and all I get is depression, anxiety and mistreatment.

However, there is one thing that I always constantly think about. Like, everyday. I keep it to myself, because I feel like that's the best course of action. It has to do with relationships.

I've realized that the only person who I genuinely want to be in a relationship with is my best friend (Female). I've known her since middle school, and over time my attraction and care for her has only risen. She is currently in a relationship, which I respect, so I don't have the courage to open up about my own personal feelings towards her on this level, since I believe that it would damage our friendship. I've been dating other women to see if that would help shift my feelings, but I've mostly just accepted the idea that I need to just move forward and focus on my career.

I don't have anyone to really talk about this with, and I think that it's ironic that I would discuss it on Reddit.. but then again, I'm only just a username to everyone here.

ForeverAlone,"1. Write a sad internet post how you can't get a girlfriend because you are a ugly loser and it makes you sad. Don't act bitter, don't act jealous, don't doubt the fairness of the dating market. If you do that they'll blame your **misogynistic personality**. Just put yourself down and apologise for even writing this post
2. That's when the normies come in to tell you that actually, you are propably very attractive (not that it matters because it's all about personality) and you just need a little bit more confidence and to not be so focused on dating. Focus on being 100% content with your life, hobbies and approaching women with no ulterior motives. Once you reach the perfect mindset you **will find someone**
3. Now you have to agree with everything they said and instantly get over your feeling of hopelesness. If you don't they'll blame your **whiny personality**. Go out there, self improve, join clubs, get therapy. If you doubt that it's going to pay of even for a second you have lost
4. After spending a few year doing all of this without results go back to the forum and say it. That you did everything they told you to do and it changed nothing. Get told that actually it was never meant to change anything, dating is a game of chance and girlfriends don't just appear once you finish a task list.

ForeverAlone,"Okay. So I have figured out the game behind Tinder, and many other dating apps. 
To start, did we all honestly expect a company to have an honest goal of hooking individuals up? Everytime someone matches, it creates risk for the company. Obviously they make it difficult for you to match by shadowing your account, and enticing you to give them money for a ""Premium membership"" which will in no way better your chances. I used Tinder for almost 2 years before I realized the extent of this game. The risk for the company is that they lose 2 users everytime someone successfully matches. I was going berserk thinking ""What is wrong with me, why does every single girl ghost me?"". Well in truth, some do, but most don't. Tinder actually limits the amount of messages you can send and receive per day. They don't tell you this. So you can send as many messages as you want, they can say ""delivered"" but in truth, they have not been delivered. Sometimes they won't deliver for weeks. Tinder is a joke of a dating app, and quite frankly a massive scam. Many of its users are bots with pictures harvested from Facebook.

When people have relationships with each other, either romantic or platonic, somebody always has something to offer.

ForeverAlone,"I'm an emotionally starved person with no understanding on what love is, I can't grasp the idea on what makes it so desirable, myself included. I don't think I've ever fallen in love or felt any genuine commitment to someone because I stop myself from it. I've been told before that I'm not loveable nor fit for it and I wasn't really allowed to feel the way I wanted so it was something I no longer gave a chance to try and only lived my life in isolation and emotional detachment. It seems unrealistic for me now to be in a relationship, I can't see it happening myself either and the idea of it seems uncomfortable now. If I start developing feelings towards someone, I cut ties with them and let my emotions die out overtime.

Anytime someone confesses their feelings towards me I don't take it serious and only assume it's out of satire. I ask myself what is there to gain from it? What do these people want?  Maybe they're confusing love with loniness, self gratification, human needs, etc. I don't really believe anyone would genuinely have any attraction towards me, thinking about it from a logical perspective instead of emotional, I have no good qualities and no personality, I'm emotionally unavailable and always self deprecating which helps keep people away. Aside from all that I somehow feel like I have lots of love to give but I know I won't be a good partner so I have to be a heartbreaker and let them down, but being in love it's not easy to let go of someone so if it escalates I let them chase me until they give up and move on or I disappear and let them move on by human nature until they find the right one because I know they'll be happier when they find them even if it hurts temporarily. I don't see myself as a loss so I don't think I'm really hurting anyone by ghosting, in fact I feel like I'm helping and pushing them to the right direction. 


Nowadays I don't see anything special of it, marriage is meaningless in my eyes, starting a family is pointless, commiting yourself to someone sounds like a second job. That doesn't mean I go hating on others in relationships or anything, I'm happy for them, I just have trouble understanding how it makes them happy or what it feels like. I think a part of me wants to find meaning in it and for some reason I want to know what it feels like. But again, I think it's better to stay where I am and remain unconscious of it. As confusing and destructive this is, I think I can say that this isn't love.

The feelings and sensations seem so real, I can feel the women‚Äôs touch and I‚Äôm nervous but excited about what‚Äôs happening. I feel more alive in my dreams than I do when I‚Äôm awake. There was one I had a couple weeks ago that I remember pretty well where I had a girlfriend, we had just started dating and I took her home to meet my family and everyone liked her, they got along and we just hung out. It felt so real. And when I woke I was devastated and I know it sounds dramatic but I thought I was going to die right then and there from a broken heart, that my whole body couldn‚Äôt take it anymore and was just going to give out.

I hate that I'm envious of others' success at romantic relationships. I find myself constantly comparing myself to others to figure out what it is that I'm doing wrong. I hate to say and sound like a complete asshole but, there are many people I know personally that I would think wouldn't be desirable partners. These people are huugely overweight, either living off of unemployment by choice or less than desireable jobs, and can't hold decent conversation beyond their favorite The Voice performer. 

Meanwhile, I have strived to make myself as much of an attractive partner as I can possibly be. I have a decent career making adequate money, I go to the gym 4-5 times a week, I have developed my personable skills among my peers and yet I'm still considered a less than desirable choice. Everyone I speak to thinks I'm just oh so great but anyone I try to start a relationship with or get to know personally is like ""hard no"". 

It just goes to show that if you don't have a desirable face you wont be wanted. I tried explaining this to my mother that I am simply not physically attractive enough to have a partner. I told her that people close to me either have a biased view of me or don't want to hurt my feelings. She said she agreed because she thought that I am just wonderful.

ForeverAlone,"I am 23 years old. I have been a member of this community since I was 17. I'm a virgin that has never kissed, held hands or been on a date. My virginity and inability to attract women has been a source of my insecurities for a while. I have always felt inferior to women and other men. 

I have recently been stepping out of my comfort zone in various ways. One of those ways have been hitting on four different women. Rejected by them all. Tried different dating apps. No results. Other than that I've done other women related stuff that I never thought I could do. One of those things was that I recently landed a great job after finishing university last year. Took a while to get but now I have some cash to spare. It just seems impossible for someone to like me to acquire intimacy through normal means. 

I used to be scared of seeing a prostitute because I always had hope for a first time. That first time never comes. I also held some strage ideas about purity. At this point, I kind of stopped caring. I just don't want to feel inferior. 

So, my dear fellow FA, what do you think? Should I go see a prostitute? I want the ones that provide GFE. I assume they let you kiss them. Because if I'm paying so much to lose my virginity, I might as well get my first kiss too. And my first cuddle. Also if you have experience with prostitutes, would you want to share some tips?

ForeverAlone,"I'm so demoralized with sites like Tinder and OKCupid that I just don't even feel motivated to try anymore. Seriously -- I have professional photos mixed with action shots to show that I do things, profiles constructed based off of guidebooks, and messages based off of both their profiles and advice I've read in entire advice columns dedicated to online dating; and yet I'm either doing something wrong or just never ranking high enough amidst the other candidates present, because nothing goes anywhere past one call tops before the woman I'm interested in ghosts me. Some even agree to or propose a call themselves and act like it's still happening up past the point when it's supposed to happen before going silent (one of them when I jokingly messaged her sometime after that told me to ""eat an enormous dick"" after previously bombing me with friendly words and heart emojis).  I'm certainly better at online dating than I was before, but still not to the point where I've really gotten anyone, and I don't understand all the bizarre counter-intuitive rules of online ""game"" where things that people plainly say are somehow secretly code for something totally different and I'm supposed to just know. I even recently tried signing up for local virtual speed dating events, only to find that they were both a scam in their own respective way (one non-existent, the other a poorly coordinated worldwide one where everyone was duped into thinking it was local and everyone was put on calls with several peopl at once). Nothing feels real or promising at all anymore. It's hard to feel motivated to do anything through online avenues when it just feels like it's going to wind up like the last several cases no matter how promising it looks in the moment.

I actually have not been interested in online methods for finding a date for some time, and I've been wanting to take time to do stuff like go downtown and meet people and try to chat to woman I'm interested the ""old-fashioned way"". But ever since the COVID situation started, a lot of stuff has been closed down, it's harder to know where the line is as far as safely interacting with new people, and it's harder to even hear someone through masks. I volunteer regularly for a homeless shelter, but I'm in a sequestered room where there's no one else so that I can get people their mail from past a divider. Part of me feels like I'm just being lame and that there must be some way I can find to get a date through in-person means, but I also just don't know how to navigate all this stuff. I've mostly stopped doing things that involve going out (though vaccine stuff gives some horizon for me).

The whole situation has got me so frustrated, mainly with myself, that I've found myself self-harming again.

So does anyone have any input on ways they've found to find dates beyond the tired online shit and that still works within the boundaries of our situation? Keep in mind I'm operating on the premise of COVID and according safety measures being essentially valid, so please no posts telling me ""fuck the masks/distancing, quit being a Soros-sheep"" or trying to tell me how it's all NWO and ""just get out there"" or whatever. I really want to get out of this. Even feeling a sense of enjoyment and progress out of dating again would be good.

.

I'm honestly fine with romance in fiction if it's done well--I'm reading and enjoying ""Three Comrades"" right now--but as we were discussing ""11/22/63"" and our different opinions on it, my friend made it more and more clear that he thought I just didn't 'get' the book, that since I didn't have a partner or any romantic experience, I couldn't understand how well done the romance apparently was in the story. This was on a group call with others who read the book, and I felt pretty dismissed and indignant about this. Everyone else in the book club was married, most had kids too, and normally this doesn't bother me much, but suddenly I realized some in the group view me as fundamentally different from them just for being romantically inexperienced at 27. They're basically saying my input on the book doesn't count as much as theirs does on that basis alone. It wasn't a nice feeling.

ForeverAlone,"I'm a 23 y/o man, I'm still a virgin and I can't get a girlfriend and never been on a date, despite trying my best. I have struggled with women and social anxiety issues my whole life. My sister, however, has no problems, she can get a boyfriend and have him for 3 years and not struggle with getting a new one after a week when he breaks up with her. Normally, i don't care about this because i try not to think about it, but i'm visiting my family, her and my parents and they keep bringing up her love life. They keep bringing up the old ex, he cheated on her and the girl he left sis for cheated on him. They made a big deal about it and were laughing and mocking him. She started telling them how good the new guy treats her. Dad wants to meet him.

It made me feel upset. Being lonely is a very sensitive subject for me. I reflected how i'm almost 7 years older and don't have any fun experiences to share, i have nobody at all, i can't get anybody, i'm basically unlovable. They hardly even spoke to me, sis's love life was the talk of the town. They talked and joked about her boyfriend and some other people she'd dated for a long time, i didn't want to be rude so i just stayed. She's had so many adventures i'll never to and have never experienced. Going to prom with her ex, i skipped out on mine, someone to share her accomplishments with, i wish i had something like that. I was incredibly upset, i wanted to cry, but kept fighting it. I tried not to show it but i kept sighing and rolling my eyes at them, but keeping to myself in the corner. I kept quiet, they finally asked me how i was and i just kinda shrugged. The conversation finally switched, but to me.

Mom just made a comment about my sister being a casanova with the boys and looked over at me and asked why i never brought any good women home for us to meet. Again, i just shrugged, said i tried, it just doesn't work out. Mom said ""Maybe if you lost weight and gave up that anime bullshit, maybe put in a little effort then you could get one."". I didn't say anything, i wanted to say it was because of their bad genetics, i got screwed up really bad genetically, my body just didn't develop properly, i'm short and kinda funny looking, oddly proportioned. Plus on the chubby side. She said there were no excuses for not trying and that they were my age when i was already in pre school. They want grandkids to carry on our last name and i'm the only one who can.

The last thing dad said was ""You know, he might be gay. I mean, it's cool if you are, just be honest about it, so we can support you."" I wanted to say i'm not gay, just unlovable. But mom brought up to the whole family that i have a waifu. Which, i know is weird, but i can't help it. I love a fictional character and it helps bridge the loneliness gap.

I just want my family to stop. Stop asking me about getting a girlfriend, stop throwing my sister's happiness in my face and i can't deal with it anymore. I can't just leave, i took a bus and can't get another one for about a week. I'm stuck and have to deal with it. All they ever talk about is my sister's love life and i hate it.

But then you actually talk to those people dig a bit deeper into the subject and they start talking about all the other things you need to do. 

\- First you need to be confident about yourself

\- Then you need to completely forget about finding someone and just focus on your own hobbies

\- Then you need to start 100% casual friendships with women if they happen to share your hobbies but also carefuly analyse their body language looking for signals of attraction

\- Here comes my favourite part, then you need to patiently wait for a woman to show signals of attraction to you which might not necessarily come soon since all women have different preferences

\- Then you have to confidently and directly but not in an awkward or pushy way ask her out. Be natural but control your body language

\- You also have to get used to dealing with rejections like a man since there is gonna be plenty of them, you have no guarantee she's going to agree

\- If you do this enough times then and only then eventually you are going to find someone. It might take months. It might take years. Love comes when you least expect it. But it will happen eventually

And then it turns out that being confident isn't a fool proof solution afterall but just increases your chances from 0,01% to 0,02% and changes absolutely nothing in the way you did things before since you still need to follow this tedious trial and error routine.","""Confidence is all you need""",Fit-Communication-19

I'm 27 years old, I live in Italy and I can't find a girl who loves me. When I was younger (my teens), I never strived for companionship: I had so many mental issues, I was very shy and, above all, I thought I was asexual. But, after a lot of health struggles, I found myself in need for a girlfriend. Since when I was 21, I asked out like 20-25 girls, obtaining three dates. The first one, evolved in a short relationship, the second one, well, I don't know, we were something like kiss-friends (I don't know if this word exists), the third girl just ghosted me after some time. But what bothers me, it's that in 27 years I never had a true bond with a girl. I'm not handsome, but I'm not even that ugly. Yes, in this moment I'm overweight, but I'm trying to get skinnier. I see my peers, some of them are marrying, some having kids, and I'm just lucky enough to say that I'm not virgin anymore.

It made me so anemic that I had to get iron infusions two years in a row. Once that seemed to get under control, I was diagnosed with Rheumatoid Arthritis a few months before my 30th birthday. Basically, one condition makes me gain weight really fast, while the other causes me to randomly be in severe pain.

All of this together has made my social life difficult and my dating life seemingly impossible. Thankfully I do have one friend that also has an inflammatory disease and understands what I‚Äôm going through. But the rest seem to not really get it. Especially now. Dating is harder because going out is not always easy, and all the ups and downs I‚Äôve had with my body only elevate my insecurities.

Communicating on dating apps is just such a fucking struggle on its own. When I finally feel like I connect with someone, I try to open up about it. Either I get zero empathy about everything or they just pretend to care for a little while, then I eventually get ghosted.

I‚Äôve gotten to a point where I‚Äôm just numb to the idea of having to live the rest of my life alone. But that also has just made me more depressed and sad all the time. 

Should I have faith that I might meet someone that is caring and patient enough to spend the rest of their life with a partner whose health will just continue to worsen the older I get...maybe. But I‚Äôm just over trying to be hopeful because it makes having to face the disappointment sting more. 

Ok I‚Äôm stepping off the soapbox now. Thanks for listening.",Forever Alone...in Pain [F32],lolaisbunny

ForeverAlone,"I‚Äôm 31 y/o male and haven‚Äôt been with a girl in 8 years. I had a few chances over the years but due to either low self-esteem or being a legitimate alcoholic at the time, I never really capitalized on them. Now that it feels I‚Äôm older and uglier, the opportunities are more few and far between. I‚Äôm working out regularly trying to become good looking, hoping that gets me a girlfriend someday. And doing my best to get rich fast,  is the stock market and poker but unfortunately that has had the opposite effect and I‚Äôve lost about $1,000 the past 2 weeks. I have absolutely no self-confidence. A week ago I noticed the most beautiful girl I have ever seen at a Mexican food place and I could not take my eyes off her, she made eye contact with me twice from a distance and might have even been interested but she was with her friends and I did not have the courage to walk up and potentially be ridiculed by the lot of them. 

I am seriously crying every day, and occasionally cutting my wrists. I‚Äôm in a sober living and unfortunately just started sneaking a drink from time to time to cope. I do not want to do this because it‚Äôs bad for fitness/ sleep/ muscle recovery but when you‚Äôre as depressed as me sometimes you just want some artificial serotonin.

ForeverAlone,"I don't like being alive. I've been alone my entire life. Even when I had friends i still felt alone. I have an emptiness and inner inadequacy that nobody I've ever met understands. 

Now I'm entering my late 30s. Whatever good looks I've ever had are well into the process of deterioration. My teeth have never been great, even when I was younger. I have a gut. 

All I want to is experience what it's like to be the center of somebody's universe and have someone at the center of mine. But I'm not willing to put myself out there. Part of the reason is that if I did meet a girl I clicked with out in the real world, I would visibly c*m in my pants. Even if it was just a mild attraction. This has plagued me all my life and robbed me of my self-confidence. So I have tried Tinder, Bumble, Hinge, OkCupid. Over the course of several years I have probably been on a dozen dates, two second dates, and one relationship where the girl eventually told me she had been seeing someone else the entire time. I am tired of dating apps and not willing to put any more time or effort into them.

I've had sex once. 

Whatever friends I've ever had, I don't want to see anymore. They are all relatively happy people living relatively happy lives. They have romantic relationships that come and go. I'm tired of being that perpetually single guy. Being around them, hearing about their relationships and their happy lives, I just want to cry uncontrollably. It's easier to just not see them, not talk to them, not hear about them. They text me but I don't reply. They call me but I don't answer. They're going to ask me how I'm doing. They already know how I'm doing. 

I thought going outside on this mild, sunny day would lift my mood. All it does is make me realize I have nowhere to go, nothing to do, nobody to see.

I don't want to die. But I don't want to live. And I think the latter is starting to win out over the former.

ForeverAlone,"I haven't had sex in about 7 years. I took a break from dating for 5-6 years and finally got back in the game about 7 months ago. Since then, I've had dates with 5 girls off of dating apps and haven't been able to get any of them truly off the ground. 3 of the girls I felt like I had a connection with but within 2 or 3 weeks they all started pulling away or stopped talking to me altogether. I'm starting to get the feeling that no matter what I do, I'll either never be able to keep a girl interested enough in me to have a serious relationship or they'll see that I'm not confident with women and won't want anything to do with me! It doesn't help that I suck at the texting game which is most of what dating is nowadays. 

Even though I know I'm a good looking guy, it just seems like I'll never get anything right and I'm sick of getting my hopes up, just to get super depressed every time things don't work out.

ForeverAlone,"23 this year, never been on a date, never done anything, not even hold hands romantically with a guy. i've had a total of maybe 3 crushes on guys before, one when i was 13 (this was more like a brief infatuation), another when i was 18 (lasted about a year) and the last crush i had was when i was 19 (still kinda like him, but idek him and ive only seen him like 4 times). i‚Äôm not close to any of them, only had brief interactions with them a few times. and this is just me venting/telling strangers about my crushes lol, for anyone who‚Äôs bored or curious haha. 

the second guy i had a crush on, when i was 18, the first time i saw him was at this event that my school organised. my first impression of him was that i thought he looked a bit like the first guy i had a crush on lol. and because of that i kept on taking glances at him and stuff. but it wasn't until another event's rehearsal that we interacted that i started liking him. at the rehearsal, we were supposed to queue up according to the number given to us before going on stage and mine happened to be in front of his. so when i was trying to queue up i went to him and asked him what his queue number was, then he started asking me like 2 or 3 questions, like which class am i from etc, but me being the shy introvert i am, only gave him small replies and only smiled most of the time. so it was just a really really brief conversation. apart from that he also cracked a joke with his friend one time, and i turned around and laughed at his joke then he cheered me (and another person) on when we went on the stage before him. i know i don't know anything about him, but i really liked the friendly outgoing happy vibe he gave? that was when i knew what **type** of guy i actually like. i was thinking ""that's it. that's exactly what i look for in a guy""

and then a year later, i met another guy. i was working as a cashier part-time for a food stall (only for about a week) at a uni and this guy started talking to me. the first time i saw him i couldn't really remember what he looked like but that conversation kinda left an impression on me. then another day of work, i was really hoping to see him again. i don‚Äôt really remember how long it took but i did (saw him again). the second time he came, him being the friendly person he was, he was just having a chat with my boss and he kinda mentioned me a bit in the convo but i wont go into details. then the third time i saw him, he waved at me!!! (even though we barely talked, also could be the fact that i was staring at him from a distance lol) and i remember being so excited to see him haha but when he asked me to recommend him what to eat, i completely blanked out. i was just like ""uh...."" and couldn't think of anything to say, because that was my first and only week working there and i had no idea which food was good so i didn't want to recommend something he might not like. but he noticed how i have nothing to say so he was like ""nevermind"" lol. i still feel slightly embarrassed to this day lol. but anyway that was my last day working there so i didn't see him again :/ i did, however, find him on social media sites so there's that. dude probably doesn't even know my name though (we didn't exchange names, i found out his name from my boss) and i didn't dare to add him on the sites because otherwise he would think that i'm a creepy stalker (which i kinda regretted now cause it would be even weirder to add him now, a few years later) (and i also feel like im giving off creepy stalker vibes just lurking on his social media sites). 

so yeah, brief convos, but i liked him because of how approachable he was, how willing he was to talk to me even though we don't even know each other at all, and how friendly he was to everyone. he also gave off the kinda vibe that i really really like in a person, the aforementioned positive happy nice kinda vibe. not a lot of people have that kind of personality, at least not around me. but sadly i don't think he even remembers me, especially not after me being quiet asf (and panicking in my head) when he's trying to make small talk lol.

and fast forward to last month when i created accounts on a few different dating apps, and started chatting with guys on those apps. but after only a week, i deleted/deactivated all my accounts because 1) my socially anxious ass cannot handle them, talking on those apps suck the life out of me 2) none of the guys are **him**, the last crush i've had. 

i started thinking about how i probably will just be alone for the rest of my life lol. if the guy doesn't have that one very specific personality trait that i'm looking for, then i don't even feel anything for them. but if they do, i go head over heels for them, even though i barely know anything about them. which makes me think that i don‚Äôt actually like them, but i only like the *idea* of them, which means that i‚Äôve never had a real crush before?

so yeah anyway, just saying, in my 23 years of living, i've only ever liked 2 guys (or at least the idea of them) and they both share a pretty similar personality trait; gives out the friendly happy not-serious wholesome kinda vibe. which i honestly think it's difficult to find in a person, especially in my surroundings. i study engineering so i see quite a lot of guys in my school, and i also have joined a few clubs/societies but it's just that none of the guys i've seen so far have that kinda vibe.

but honestly it's not just that, no one has ever told me they like me before, and i don't consider myself pretty either, i also have a boring personality, very quiet, shy, introverted, socially anxious, so what even are the chances of the person i like actually liking me back? like why do i even bother thinking i can get into a relationship someday amirite lol. but i do love the idea of that and im always happy to hear relationship stories. i stay hopeful LOL üòÇ but also, sometimes i think being alone aint that bad either haha so yeah, i‚Äôll just go with the flow i guess üòÖ

I spend more than 95% of my time alone so I basically have no choice but to accept it. So I wrote [this song](https://open.spotify.com/track/01iOt9kebrIfNnTrcMPi7w?si=ad216b15894a4b47) called ['To Be Alone'](https://open.spotify.com/track/01iOt9kebrIfNnTrcMPi7w?si=ad216b15894a4b47), and you can probably guess what it's about.",I wish I wasn't attracted to anybody.,Jax_Gatsby
ForeverAlone,"Whenever you disagree with someone especially when it comes to dating, you immediately get told you have a 'toxic personality' and 'this is why you stay single'.

Because apparently, freedom of speech venting about your horrible life experiences which can include things such as trauma, childhood bullying, abuse, parental neglect; people claim, 'you are entitled' 'you don't deserve a real relationship' when you are honest and release about your horrific past which is supposed to bring light and relief to your future; instead gets shutdown by arrogant fuckers with their heads shoved so far up their own arses they couldn't even see what empathy looked like.

ForeverAlone,"I've always thought that our feelings as FAs might be very similar to physically disabled people.
One of the many thoughts that makes me super angry and depressed is the fact that people get into relationships so easily and it's just a natural and obvious part of their lives.
 Maybe we can say the same for disabled people. walking and seeing are such natural and ordinary things that people just happen to do and they didn't do anything to deserve being able to do them and a person who was born blind won't even know how seeing feels even in their dreams and a person with serious leg impairment has to watch people walk like it's nothing and the best he can do is just deal with the negative feelings and enjoy other aspects of life.
Well there is some minor differents like how society thinks about them and treats them vs us but I think in the end what we feel is just a lesser version of the feelings of a physically disabled person .

It was going so great she called in and we spent the night hanging out. When she text me the next morning, she said she had a blast and could not wait to do it again soon.

ForeverAlone,"I've recently made the steps to begun accepting that this girl I have been very hung over for at least this past year if not longer; is just not attracted to me. 

When we'd talk she'd never be overly invested in caring about anything else except her dating life. Sometimes in a group setting she'd admire something about me but that would be all.

When I first met her, I remember discussing with her randomly about typical boy behaviour. She said something about how boys always treat her then I said 'most up and leave'. She was like 'you're the first boy to have ever said that'. I was like, sounds great she's already seeing some positive impressions of me.

Did that change a damned thing? Of course not. She still chased after all those good looking bad boys. Seeing who she was with in the past; knowing exactly why she fancied him so much, or her mum constantly, so much triggering thoughts that make me feel so low thinking about how much I desire her. Then I just keep wondering to myself if I am just selfish and demanding?

I think some of my actions have been babyish. But I do not believe they are not valid. I have lived a life of rejection for no other obvious reason other than my appearance. I work hard on it still to this day; but the bottom line is I cannot change whether someone is attracted or not.

So after realising this. I felt guilty that I would only ever talk to this girl when I felt a good energy and wondered if I could pursue her any further. She then just got into a new relationship so I stopped pursuing her as much and that hit me like a truck.

It doesn't matter how much I know she's not interested I can never prepare myself when she starts dating someone new. I planned to tell her how I feel 3 days before she got in that new relationship. But then again; if I waited three days I was probably never gonna tell her.

Having to go to work everyday thinking about her wondering if she's ever going to reciprocate my feelings is really my own fault; but something that is getting very tough to bear. So I managed to change my shifts and do a few different things in my lifestyle like keeping myself well so I can be more content with myself and my life during heartbreak.

If she ever does become single again I will try to tell her and ask her out. But I honestly just don't think she cares. So for this reason, I thought, better to stay out of the way and \*maybe\* possibly, provoke a thought or two about me this way by giving her space; rather than desperately trying to cling onto her every move rather than continuously hoping something will change when it just won't.

Bottom line is, these kind of feelings is why falling in love feels so desperately exhausting. I cannot keep up with it much longer and is starting to take over my life and wellbeing. So I thought to myself telling her how I feel hopefully eventually can be a sign of closing the doors on allowing myself to get too easily attached in the future.",Staying away from a girl you are attracted to because you don't want to be disingenuous and because you care about what they want,Vast_Ad7036

\-Starts college fresh out of being constantly bullied in hs w/ no self esteem or confidence. Rail thin guy and incredibly short (I looked like a fucking 15 year old and still do).

\-Due to extreme lack of social skills and confidence is fucking hand-holdless virgin.

\-Spends first two years wallowing in self pity and not working for shit for my Statistics B.S.major, grades are horrid and so is social life.

\-Eventually things change (for better the one and only time) over summer after sophomore year, loses virginity, gains confidence, becomes motivated with school and content with life (for the first ever time since I started learning to fucking walk). However, also kicked off a terrible habit with drugs/alcohol.

\-Only do work on heart-stopping amounts of adderall, only social when drunk/high, cocaine habit, I strip myself of being able to do anything naturally (well cause I can't do shit myself anyway).

\-Fast foreward to my covid-defined senior year: Must take 18 credits (12 of them 200-lvl STAT courses) to graduate, no fucking girl or really anyone who gives a fuck about me or my mental, freinds I gained are gone due to covid, campus is on fucking lockdown.

Constantly feel like shit from this, Im barely eating or sleeping, rarely ever sober when I finish work because all I wanna do is fucking escape. I can't take this stress of catching up from my previous self anymore.

WHY AM I SO FUCKING STUPID?!? WHY CANT I JUST WORK AND SOCIALIZE LIKE A NORMAL FUCKING PERSON WITHOUT BEING ON DRUGS??

WHY DO I ALWAYS JUST ISOLATE MYSELF FROM EVERYONE OUT OF ANXIETY WHEN IN REALITY I JUST WANT TO TALK TO THEM?

WHY DOES EVERYONE LOOK AT ME WHEN I WALK BY LIKE I LOOK LIKE A SERIAL KILLER JUST BECAUSE OF HOW OBVIOUSLY DEPRESSED AND LONLEY I AM???

ForeverAlone,"*So people say.*

*Part one* is some general thoughts about that. *Part two* is some academic papers I'm quoting.  You might want to skip one part and read only the other.

I'm not sure what the claim being made by those who say ""sex is overrated"" actually is. It seems to be one of those throwaway claims that flirt with obvious hypocrisy.

I could accept that a monk (or someone living a voluntarily celibate life) has some grounds for the claim that sex is overrated, given that the monk has given up sex for an ostensible higher cause. But the claim is rarely heard from monks, instead it comes from those who have active sex lives. So if it is so overrated, why does a*lmost everyone on the planet* continue to eagerly participate? The average adult has sex at least 50 times a year - (and that for each year, for almost every year of their life, up to the beginnings of old age)  - sex being a key part of most people's development, their sense of self, and the future they imagine. So rather than being a valid point of view, the ""sex is overrated and not important"" appears to be little more than a dismissive grumble, a grumble that disregards the complaints of the sexless.

Let's look at the same argument from its different angles:

*""Society is too over sexualised, sex isn't even that good""*

Maybe it is true that society fosters bad sex and encourages a sort of compulsory promiscuity these days. Modern social norms favour no strings attached throwaway sex, sex that is all about notch making - how many notches can you collect? -- and ego. (Society also stays entirely quiet about the deeper spiritual meanings to be found in sex, rooting instead its narrative only in ideas of fun, frolics and freedom). The antics of the air heads on Love Island type shows are good examples of this sort of profligate, notch making sex. So, if someone were to specify that a one night stand is ""overrated"" and ""actually not that good"" it would be a reasonable claim to make in that context. But that is actually more about the *limits of hedonism* than it is about the importance of sex. It doesn't indicate that sex is overrated, it only shows that a particular way - a culturally prescribed way - of doing it is. It's like saying ""driving is overrated"" while you faff about doing doughnuts in a car park.

I don't even like the claim, though, that casual sex is ""meaningless"" - many things are surely meaningless, but still offer value, personal growth, self expression, etc. Going for a walk, for example, is a ""meaningless"" way to spend one's time but seeing the birds, trees, sky etc. still adds a certain something to life. As someone once said ""it may be true that hookup sex is meaningless, but as meaningless things go, it's still damn good"". That is why people do it after all. But really there is no such thing as meaningless sex  - sex always has meaning inherent to it, whether that is positive or less so. If meaningless sex was so meaningless, it would not be the case that almost everyone indulges, or has indulged in an experimental period.

*""Sex does not even feel that good""*

No one who is sexless imagines there is some ethereal pleasure only to be found during intercourse. Obviously the physical sensations of a penis in a vagina can be duplicated, and quite easily so - though feedback would remain elusive. So if one were to say, strictly speaking, that ""the pleasure obtained from an orgasmic spasm is overrated"" that could be somewhat true. But sex, obviously, is not just about friction and expulsion - no one has sex for that reason (or, if they did initially, continues to go back to it for that reason). If sex was just about the friction there would be no logical reason for partnered sex at all - one's own hand would suffice for the job. Sex, instead, is more than that - it galvanises the different parts of our being, the physical self, the emotional self, the spiritual self, and maybe for a moment gathers it together into some sort of whole. Masturbation can not compete, however ""intense"" it may be. The value of sex comes from its context, a context that requires closeness, intimacy, affection, etc. Sex always occurs within a context, and it is that context (connection to another, the sense of being wanted by someone one wants, of being seen as desirable, or reciprocal exchanges of intimacy, of being able to form purposeful bonds, etc) that is its importance.

*""No one died from a lack of sex""*

Of course not. But a life worth living requires more to make it so than ""not dying"". There are very few things that someone died from not doing - not eating, not drinking, not finding shelter, etc.

The motivation to belong is a fundamental psychological need (maybe one of our strongest psychological needs as humans) and its being frustrated, or not met, or forever 'stuck' in a state of unfulfillment, could only decrease our sense of well being. Sex is one of the greatest manifestations we have of belongingness, of acceptance from others, of being welcome and wanted, of being seen as a desirable person. Every poll conducted on the topic concludes that sexual expression is rated by almost all adults as a central part of a ""fulfilling life"". So to not have sex means something. It doesn't mean death, of course, for no one ever died from a lack of sex, but it means *something crucial* is missing from life. The effects on mental health, on self esteem, etc. of living long term without sex aren't even known, and they aren't because (as far as I know) the subject hasn't ever been studied. Nuns have been studied, of course, but that is not relevant - voluntary celibacy is obviously not relevant. We can reasonably predict frustration, bitterness, and disappointment - the same negative outcomes to be found for when any human wish or want that isn't met or *feasibly even able to be met.*

There are various studies on the benefits of sex, but I'm not convinced by most of them. Benefits of having sex suggested by what I've read include aiding memory, improving immunity, lowering blood pressure, lowering stress, supporting self esteem, and lowering rates of depression - with an active sex life being associated with better health, and with longer living. There are obvious issues here regarding cause and correlation and also the dubious relevance of some of the studies coming from animal models. Personally, I don't think the issue is particularly well studied, especially not from the FA point of view. There is surprisingly little data to be found (well, what I could find) on the harms of living without sex.

I'll add some quotes from articles I found below. They are all available online, so you can read the full papers yourself, if you like.

You may wonder why it's so hard to talk to others and make good friends. The thing is, it really IS you that is the problem that cannot be fixed. 
People like to say 'learn to socialise' like it's learning ABC. Actually, you dont learn to socialise. 

Socialisation is NOT a skill. It's an accumulation of knowledge and experience you are able to show toward others. If you are a complete nobody with no funny stories or experiences to share, you'll always fail in talking to others. In making friends. In group gatherings. In meetings. In dates.

Every conversation starts with a question but a continuation from there requires the interest of both parties. And how do you fulfil the interest of both parties if not for shared interests or something to gain from each other or at least to give the other party? This is the reciprocity that is what makes socialisation. A contribution to the other party, be it by knowledge, skill-sharing or some other form of benefit. Even being the funny joker is the same, because you're contributing entertainment to the other party.

These are how I classify contributions to a conversation: 1. Tell an interesting slice-of-life story 2. Tell a joke 3. Tell an interesting fact 4. Raise topics/insights to think about

Most importantly, for all of these 4 you choose from, make sure what you're saying is RELEVANT to the other party.

If a conversation is going to be you describing what you do at work, what you do at home and straight forward facts about your life and hobbies, no one is going to want to talk to you for long. Because they gain NOTHING from you.

So how can you be an expert at socialising? Can you train for it? No, I'm sorry. You can't. All these motivational talks about 'be yourself' and 'open yourself up' are utterly pointless. They work to an extent...yes, true. But not for long. How does 'be yourself' help if you're a boring person to begin with? How does 'open yourself up' help when you're a person full of bad histories and flaws better to be concealed lest to raise red flags?

This is why if you: A) have a boring life B) have little social connections C) have slow-thinking and inept comedic personality

A lot of people's conversations actually revolve around themselves and their experiences. So if you're the kind that spent the past 10 years of your childhood sitting in front of the computer playing Minecraft, you can forget it about impressing the other party unless the other person's whole life revolves around Minecraft too.",The sad truth about socialisation,tossaway3244

‚Ä¢ Obviously the typical one of never had a relationship. Imagine the baseball field metaphor for relationships. If you added me to that equation, I would be about 100 miles away from first base. 

‚Ä¢ Never had any legitimate friends outside of acquaintances or online friends, besides a short period in elementary school, if that. Online friends come with a whole other problem. It just isn‚Äôt the same as real life to me, though I do care about some of them a lot, it just isn‚Äôt the same. 

‚Ä¢ I have issues with social anxiety. It irks me so much that I have very little to say to people during conversations and can be so awkward around people. The problem is... I don‚Äôt have much to talk about. Nothing is really happening in my life, so I subconsciously try and make sure no one brings up something that makes me look like the biggest disappointment.

‚Ä¢ Feeling like my face is so ugly. This is actually something I don‚Äôt think I will ever get over unless I was genuinely told otherwise by people. I hate taking pictures, I hate looking at myself in pictures, sometimes even in the mirror, and I certainly don‚Äôt like showing other people my face online. Admittedly, I‚Äôm probably not actually ‚Äúugly‚Äù but below average. The point is, I don‚Äôt care about making up for my face by having a great body, I just want my face to be attractive that people can like, which is another reason why I‚Äôm so hindered by myself. I‚Äôm never going to get that. 

‚Ä¢ A constant urge of wanting things to be different, but feeling so hopeless about actually making changes because deep down I feel like it just won‚Äôt matter.

ForeverAlone,"27M here. Been single since I was 14 (had one gf at that age for a couple of months). 

I used to be heavily bullied in highschool, had no friends, let alone a SO...

I tried to ""put myself out there"" in College. It kinda worked, I had friends (girls and guys) but never managed to have a girlfriend. Not even short term relationships.

I think the problem is mostly that I am ugly. But let's get to the point : some girls SEEMED to be interested in me on a few occasions (5-6 times). Among them were a couple that were really pretty, had plenty of friends...So my thought was : why would they be interested in someone like me ? And I've never tried to ""answer back"" to the signs they gave me, which were pretty obvious sometimes because I thought they were trying make me think they liked me and humiliate me in the end.

This is my general attitude towards people (including in friendships), I'm never sure someone really likes me. I always  thinks people hang out with me to use me or make fun of me.

Something happened last year. One of the girls who was seemingly hitting on me actually came to visit me for a few days. She insisted that we slept together in my bed and quickly started to cuddle with me. We ended up kissing (didn't have sex during these few days because I was too afraid).Believe it or not, I'm still not sure this girl really liked me (it's a long story, I might tell it in details here someday). I'm pretty sure she did that out of pity or cruelty.

ForeverAlone,"2020 and this year so far has really shown me was a loser i am. Here are a couple reasons.

1. **I have social anxiety**. I don't know why i am so afraid of people, i fucking hate myself for being so scared of everything. I will most likely become a NEET in the future because of this. It prevents me from getting a job, making friends, going outside, etc. I'm  pussy
2. **I'm 18 and ask my mom for everything**. Since i can't even properly make my own money, my mom buys me things. I am now a legal adult now, and its really pathetic that i rely on my mom to buy me things. The only way I've made money independently, was drawing porn for people.
3. **I have no friends.** This ties back to the social anxiety. I have no friends because i'm afraid of talking to people. And who would want to be friends with someone who cant socialize?
4. **I'm a creep.** You wanna know when you really hit rock bottom? When you bought a body pillow with an anime girl on it (with your moms money), hoping it can be a replacement for friends. This is some borderline r/waifuism shit. I plan on talking to it, and treat it like a friend. Typing that makes me suicidal. I should really kill myself, i seriously didn't think my life would get this pathetic when i was younger.
5. **I push everyone away.** When i do end up getting close to someone, i sabotage it. I really cant trust anyone so i just start distancing myself from them. Its like i cant decide if i want to be alone or not.

There's more but that;s all i can think of right now. I'm a fucking dumbass

There are only two things that make me feel genuinely happy, and It's fitness and art (there's actually a third one, but i think i embarrassed myself enough this post).  just sucks knowing i am going to be spending life alone.

ForeverAlone,"Yes, you read it. Constant rejections from women made me bitter. I was a fool for thinking that I can get a relationship if I better myself. A fool that if I keep trying I‚Äôll definitely find ‚Äúthe one‚Äù. Well, guess what? Screw the one! I did everything I could to better myself and every time I feel ready to ask a girl out she‚Äôll turn me down in a snap. Last time I went out with a girl, I thought she was the one. We‚Äôve known each other for a quite some time, went out in a few dates and everything was going well. Until, the next following days she rarely replies to my texts, chats or calls. I asked her what‚Äôs the matter and she explained that we‚Äôll probably never work out because she‚Äôs about to go to Med school and relationships would only make her not to focus cuz Med school is her dream. So as much as that hurts, I said that I understand. But a few months later, I found out that she‚Äôs going out with a guy and I was puzzled, rage was building up in my head and I was one step away from self destruction. So, when I finally had the time to meet her again I asked her about the guy, I explained my side - why did she told me that she‚Äôs gonna get busy in Med school and no relationships allowed but she‚Äôs out there going out with some guy. She explained some shits and while she was talking I was filled with rage but as much as possible I kept it cool. But the one thing that stings the most is when she said ‚ÄúIs it my fault that I like him better than you?!‚Äù

And from that moment, I never went out with a girl ever again. I don‚Äôt believe in hope anymore, I was a fool.

ForeverAlone,"I know what the general temperament is here. I was here way back in 2014-15 on another account. Can't believe that is already 7 years ago. Life has been depressing and lonely, but I tried getting out of my comfort zone in my own way: chatting with people online, in the hopes I'll meet someone.

There wasn't much I could do to ""fix"" about the ugly side of me: short, balding (whole crowning and MBP ugly shit), dark circles around eyes, ugly, hairy noise (blackheads shit), ape-ish skull (with the balding and hollow eyes, you can guess how it looks), Asian dude (God might as well kill all chances).

As you can probably guess, ""dating life"", if it can be called as such, was horrible. Met some gold-diggers, who would start cussing when they realised I was not going to spend any money on them after just *talking* first time. Almost got dragged into the scam of a family, but backed out early.

Now recently, met another girl. And the patterns are similar: from a 3rd world country, initially never saw my face, so only judge of my character was the chat. She found me ""funny"", and we kept talking.

We have got to know each other a bit. The more I find about her, the more I wonder why would she be with me? She is pretty, has a healthy, vibrant group of friends, and it seems she had a thing for a guy in her friend circle. Could be because I never had much of a social circle, but see lots of hearts emoji and calling each other ""babe"" going around among them.

Sometimes she goes overboard to agree with me. She is always gauging my response to things and then seems to calibrate her response accordingly. Here and there, the topic of some movies came up, where the girl ditches the guy who is devoted to her. The ""sugar-daddy"" talk has also come up. She was asking me what I think of it. Felt weird, as if something like that needs to be explained? I can't tell if this is another long-con, or if I can actually have the ""luxury"" of a loving girlfriend.

Anyone have any experience with this? This is my last chance to get out of FA. I was balding in early 20s, and now in my 30s I look like in my 40s. Can't handle a betrayal or some swindling now.

ForeverAlone,"A common piece of advice for people in our position is to seek out religious groups like churches purely for the social aspect. As someone who has gone and done that. i felt it would be fair to give others in my position so that they can decide whether this is the right course for them. 

**Disclaimers**

\-This is not an endorsement of any church, or other religious institution, or an attempt to deconvert you, your religious views can and must only ever be your own. Though this post will venture into my personal thoughts on religion im going to keep it strictly FA relevant as much as possible.

\-That said i apologize beforehand if something i say comes off as offensive or harsh. 

**My personal results**

Ill start with my personal results  After doing this for just over two years ive managed to garner a gym buddy, a brief relationship with a woman and what you can just barely call a social circle.Its safe to say none of these things would have happened without the social contact that the church facilitate and my mental health has benefitted. This is not me gloating or success-posting in any way because there are major , major caveats 

**Belief**

This is obviously the most important issue, and one that many people simply ignore when telling lonely people to go to Church. The fact is that many  are simply not religious and no amount of social pressure will turn them that way. Please, if you are one of these people,  dont put yourself through the anguish of faking it just to make friends. Heres why -

There is nothing worse than sitting in church or having bible group meetups where everyone seems sincere in their beliefs but  part of you is constantly thinking ""Yah thats bullshit, not a chance that happened"", ""no you didnt see a demon, youre just looking for attention again"" ""Of course that guy said he felt healed, you surrounded him in public and made him feel awkward so he told you what you wanted to hear"".""No theres no demon making my cousin gay, his body and mind is just like that you cant . . .-"" etc etc.  

This is the key problem in joining a church for the social aspect and that alone, it robs you of your ability to be authentic, which is what all true relationships are all about. Its possible to ignore differences in thinking when the topic is music choices or sports teams or even political issues but religious views cut down to the very marrow of what a person is. Admitting to your friends that you think their favourite band sucks is salvageable, admitting to your charismatic church friends that you think the idea of the power of healing is a crock of shit means you lose those friends. 

**Trauma**

Its safe to say that those of us who regularly browse and post here are not happy people whove lived happy little lives. Put simply, were truamatised, seriously in need of human connection but with a chronic inability to form those connections. Im here to tell you that a church is not an easy solution to this problem that some would have you think, and the reason slightly contradicts my first point.Dont fall for the hype and assume that the poeple at Church will have a radically different response to you than people in your daily life have had up until this point. 

. If youre like me and this invisble shadow of outcast-dom has been following you all your life it probably wont go that much better in the church than it did anywhere else. Sure people seem alot friendlier, but this is for the same reason that retail staff are friendly, if you try to form a closer bond you find yourself rebuffed in the same way youve been everywhere else, and for the same reason. Though churches love to sell themsleves as final refuges for the abused, the wrteched and the msierable, in practice they are often quite restrictive social clubs that dont readily accept outsiders, especially unusual ones who dont tick the expected boxes. Ive often felt that the phycological welfare aspect is really only to draw people in, if you bring any problem forward to someone you trust their reaction is almost always going to emphasize closer adherence to scripture instead of usefull life advice or even the sort of pro-active assistance you hoped for. Youre suffering from depression and anxiety? Those feelings arent from God, try to draw closer to him. Theyre not interested in catering to your individuality like a real person in a real relationship would, the answer is always less of yourself. This, IMO, is something someone should only put up with if theyre convinced that theyve stumbled onto genuine spiritual insight, not just out of desperation to fit in, the answer to FA is not to become a hollowed out husk of a person with no sense of self, however painfull that perception of self currently is. 

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR -My verdict**

Churches can be great places to find likeminded people and forge bonds with a community, but they are not a stop-gap solution to systemic issues in your life. If you are not a religious person then youll at best be building very superficial relationships with the people there, and at worst risk further bitterness from possible ostracism you might recieve there in the long term. Though you could make a few friends as i have, retaining these relationships at the cost of self censure and undermining of your own individuality is just not worth it.",My honest opinion on church-going as a solution to (the not especially religious) FA,BroadToe6748

ForeverAlone,"I hate that I'm writing this but I find writing very helpful. So I'll start from the beginning of another post I made of a girl that I decided to cut ties with because frankly I thought the relationship was all too toxic. We met in school and instantly never talked to each other, completely different personalities and I was dating another girl from my church at that time and I guess didn't notice her.

Around 2 years down the line I have no idea how it happened but we just begun spontaneously talking and I guess fell for each other. Although we didn't officially date I would consider her one of my ""girlfriends"". I messed up so many times in the relationship. She's a very private person and one day we were having problems and my smart ass decided it would be a good idea to make a group add her and include 5 of our friends constantly sending private dm's between us. She was so disappointing with me but didn't stop talking to me. The time I guess it was the last straw for her was when I basically called her a prostitute on a group we had with a group of friends.

After that she didn't speak to me for 2 months. I was still attached to her and she moved on pretty quick from me which frankly hurt especially when I walked into them in class and had to act like nothing was happening. At that point in my life I was suicidal with issues with my mum and my weight because I had started under eating and the pressure I received to add weight destroyed me. So fast forward to two months and I mess it up again I told her how I felt about her once again and when she rejected me I went off on her blaming her for me being suicidal and stating "" I wish we never met "" although I can say the little time when we weren't fighting was one of the best moments of my life. I realised I had done something wrong when she sent me a voice note almost in tears. After that we didn't talk for 3 more months.

For the third time in a row we started talking again but it was different this time around. I wasn't trying to get back with her just trying to try and fix what I had done and apologise to her. We started talking much more having multiple calls and texting each other everyday. I fell for her again but I stopped myself from telling her because I knew she didn't like me back and if she did we wouldn't date because she was going through a lot of stuff and wasn't ready for a relationship. She knew about my feelings for her but we still continued talking like nothing had changed. I would confidently say she is the closest person in my life. I love her.

However, my feelings for her kept peeking through and I kept falling for her no matter what I tried. Something about me is I get hope from all types of situations and she really showed me that she cared about me and told me she loved me on multiple occasions even in person at one time. It got to a point where I tried to mentally paint myself in a bad light to convince myself that I wasn't enough for her (which I wasn't). It was so toxic on myself but I tried my best to act like I was okay but I wasn't I would have the worst of days just because she wouldn't reply to one of my messages.

So today I broke, to give context while we were talking and texting it was amazing I'd be on top of a mountain. I was happy. But the second the phone cuts or we would tell each other goodnight. I'd go back to my melodramatic life and feel depressed. I would notice all my flaws every time we wouldn't be talking. For a good month I couldn't look in a mirror without cursing myself out. So I asked her for advice on the matter because she was the only person I actually talked to. Trying my best to not make it seem like it was about her. But I'm a horrible liar and eventually it spilled out and she called me to talk about it.

I should also mention that it's hard for us to just quit talking to each other. We tried on multiple occasions. So I'm just stuck in a constant loop of us talking, I get feelings for her and it goes nowhere in a situation that should ultimately lead to a relationship.

On the call I broke, Fast forward I told her how I felt. How much I loved her and I would wait for her to be ready for a relationship no matter how long it took. She is a peer counsellor in my school and basically saw it as an opportunity to get a view on my ""feelings"" and how I was doing mentally. I got so angry because I really wanted her to respond not for a therapy session. But I never showed her that part I never will again.

I feel so horrible like I will never move on from her and we will continue talking and it will never go anywhere. I'll never meet anyone else and finally be fully happy. Frankly, I don't want to meet anyone else.

FYI People, no Success does not bring girls! I used to think that I could compensate my Self-Image problems with Professional/Financial success as girls would then think I am a Smart and Ambitious guy, but no, I am still the lousy guy who a girl doesn't even wanna meet up with.

It does not have to work out or be serious, but damn something!",WHY THE F CAN I NOT GET ANYONE!,emotionalgeeko
ForeverAlone,"I'm just genuinely curious. Does your family ever ask you if you've found a partner yet?

Mine don't. It's a double edge sword though, while it's nice not to be reminded of what i can't get, it does kinda make me self conscious.

ForeverAlone,"It was probably the best dream I've ever had in recent memory. I met a girl who was actually interested in me and we had so much fun just talking and hanging out. We went out for ice cream and it was just so amazing seeing a girl actually like me and be attracted to me.

Annndddddd then I woke up. Of course it was just a dream. That's the only place where something like this would actually happen. No girl would ever possibly be into me (guys too for that matter). Oh well, it was nice while it lasted.

ForeverAlone,I'm 6 years older than my brother but he's over shadowing me in so many ways. First off one of my biggest insecurities is my height and he's the taller than me. Even though I'm 6 years ahead of him people that don't know us assume he's the older brother. It makes me feel like shit. I'm a 24 year old and people think I'm in middle school or a freshman in highschool. Both because of my height and my looks. I never even had the chance of talking to a girl outside an academic setting but my brother has already had a girlfriend. Why was I born this shit at life? It took me forever but I'm finally graduating college this summer but I don't have much hope in myself at building a career. Since I know I can't hold down a job for long. I've had 8 different jobs so far and I burned every bridge because I get sick of working and depressed. My brother on the other had just got his first job and is having a blast. My one good friend joined the military and now I'm all alone all day everyday. My brother has friends left and right he used to be out with his friends a lot but now he's on discord talking to them playing games with them laughing making memories living life while I'm here just wasting away day after day completely alone. I made an instagram recently because I wanted to upload pics to look back on that's when I noticed I have like 30 followers (family/family friends) and him on the other hand has hundreds... I honestly don't care but it still feelsbadman. This is not me saying I hate my brother or anything like that because I couldn't ask for a better one he never rubs it in any of his accomplishments nothing like that. He treats me with respect and as one of his good friends. I just feel so pathetic telling people I'm the older brother because I'm barely anything at all.,Why do I have to be so pathetic?,4Sakura
ForeverAlone,"I don't have the same human experience with relationships that others do. I can't easily make connections.

ForeverAlone,"I (M22) feel that if you had a friend that really cared about you, they would intentionally remember your birthday. I feel like sometimes people will say ""Happy Birthday"" to you just because they saw the notification on facebook that said (insert person's name ) birthday is today.    

 If I had a girlfriend, all I would want to do for my birthday is go for dinner and spend the night together. I'm ok with not receiving all of the gifts and I'm ok with everyone I know not telling me happy birthday. I just want some quality time with my girlfriend for my birthday.

But if it's my girlfriend's birthday, I would shower her with gifts and tell her ""I love you"" in a million different ways.

ForeverAlone,"I knew something was up. She had been so distant and she said she just needed space and stuff and I believed her in a way but. Something was fishy.

I've always felt self conscious about being a boring person, there's a few people that I can actually talk to and stuff. She was one but lately she had been so dry with her messages and never wanted to call or FaceTime.

Then after maybe 40 days of leading me on she finally said she wanted to break up with me. It's been over a month since then and honestly I'm not over her yet but I guess I'll just have to wait.

I was in this sub before I met her. And I am after she left me. I can't really see myself finding anyone else. I felt lucky just to have a girl other than relatives in my life. Idk if I'll find anyone else",I knew she'd leave me,agator9
ForeverAlone,"Sometimes I think about how much mental capacity it takes to constantly manage my anxiety and depression, it would almost be impressive if it wasn‚Äôt so sad. I fake it on the daily, at work and with my family. Pretending I‚Äôm somewhat content with my pathetic excuse for an existence. I can function at work, pretend my coworkers sex/weekend stories are funny, but inside I‚Äôm dying. I can‚Äôt even guess what being intimate with a girl, physically or emotionally is like. 
Sometimes I feel so bad I can‚Äôt even handle the sadness, other times I‚Äôm so apathetic I don‚Äôt even feel alive. A sort of rollercoaster of emotional torment if you will. I‚Äôve conditioned myself to be strong, but inside I‚Äôm extremely fragile. The other day a girl at work gave me a sweater she thrifted. A week before I was talking about how I didn‚Äôt have any good warm clothes. I was dumbstruck, I played it cool and thanked her but inside I was dying. That night I just started crying, the idea that someone else actually thought of me and did something nice for me was too much, it just broke me. I‚Äôve been thinking about it since. I‚Äôve been bottling up all my sadness and emotions, but what other options do I have. Pathetic I know, but small things really effect someone as emotionally stunted as me. I‚Äôve pushed on this far, but honestly my strength is fading. I need a reason to live other than work, and consuming drugs and digital media",The strength it takes to handle FA,snotmyfault

ForeverAlone,"Kissed a girl who was so drunk she barely remembers, second one I kissed has now been my girlfriend for about a year and a half now, it didn't really fix my low self-confidence but I'm much happier now than I used to be.

Despite all that I can't keep myself from lurking on here every now and then, not to make me feel better about myself but to remember where I came from.

Maybe I'm one of the lucky ones, or maybe me considering myself FA in the first place was my brain being overly dramatic, I'm honestly not sure.

I really don't want to give you tips or platitudes you've heard hundreds of times before, but what I do know is that sometimes you can be your worst enemy. Constantly feeling ugly and unwanted is usually just that, a feeling, which after a while completely warps your perception of existence, making you think that everyone's out to get you, and that wherever you go there's this unanimous unspoken agreement that you are the most repulsive undateable human in the room.

I'm not a fan of self help books, but there is one I highly recommend called ""The Untethered Soul"", it's pretty short, and it won't instantly fix any problems you might have, but it did teach me how big of a difference there is between my own perceptions/experiences, and reality. Don't let your thoughts be a barrier, controlling you and ultimately stopping you from getting what you want.","Any other ex ""FA""s still lurking on this sub?",perceval17
ForeverAlone,"My life has improved drastically over the last 6 months. I quit drinking, I‚Äôm working out, I got a car after not having one for two years, I got a new phone and ditched my cracked-screen iPhone 6, I‚Äôm wearing new clothes, eating healthier, I‚Äôve made 5K in the stock market in the last 2 months.

Does any of this matter? No. No, none of it does. I am still alone as ever and sure these things are nice improvements but no girl cares or is there to see it. Nobody‚Äôs going to date me because I have the newest iPhone. 

I have pitiful self-confidence, it‚Äôs going to take me being a millionaire before I have the confidence to ask a girl out. And I‚Äôll need to be at Arnold Schwarzenegger level fitness. I feel so imperfect and flawed, all I want is to be good enough for a girl.

ForeverAlone,"After two particularly brutal rejections, I think I‚Äôm gonna tender my resignation. Hopefully for good, but I can‚Äôt promise I won‚Äôt download the apps again in a drunken stupor.

I finally had one girl I was making plans with. She abruptly bailed with some bs excuse and stopped responding when I offered to reschedule. Even more brutal was one match whom I was exchanging a dozen or more messages with every day for the past 3-4 days. She even said she thought I seemed like a really cool person at one point. She‚Äôd even ask me out of the blue how my day was going. I asked for her number but she asked to keep it on the app and insisted she was still interested in me so I respected her wish. Unmatched. Hey, at least it was a clear rejection.

I really gave it my all this time. I had friends and internet strangers review my profile. I even paid for the apps (not proud). I used them *a lot* each day. My messages were thoughtful and could be witty even. I read every article and piece of advice I could. Don‚Äôt try and give me more app advice in the comments; I guarantee I‚Äôve heard it already.

30-40 matches on hinge. Most were one message and done. Some lasted a few messages. Some disappeared when I asked for numbers or asked them out. Only one went to text. Zero dates. Zero calls or video calls even.

Dozen or so on bumble. Only 3 messaged me. Those exchanges were short lived.

4 matches on tinder. Lasted 1-3 messages.

People might say I‚Äôm making progress. I‚Äôm not. This is only marginally more success I‚Äôve had than the other stretches I‚Äôve used this app for. And I‚Äôve gotten skinnier and more trim since I last got on the apps. And I wasted my money this time. I‚Äôm getting older. I don‚Äôt have the time for slow progress. 

At this point, I think it‚Äôs clear I‚Äôm unloveable female repellant. No matter what I say I can‚Äôt make anyone interested. Or there will always be someone more appealing out there. My personality is so utterly awkward and repellant to women no matter what I do with my appearance it doesn‚Äôt matter.

You could say its the apps. But not like I‚Äôve had any success irl. In fact I‚Äôve turned to the apps because I have no success meeting people in person, covid or not.

This is a key moment of realization in my FA story. It‚Äôs time I put this life goal of finding a partner on ice. If someone comes knocking I‚Äôll be there. But I‚Äôm not holding my breath.

ForeverAlone,"I was recently rejected by a girl that I really liked. We talked a lot, I thought we had good chemistry and I was really, really in love with her. But it turns out she did not feel the same way as I did. I had been rejected 5 times in the past, so when I declared to her I thought that I was ready for anything. But it turns out, I was not. When I heard the ""Sorry, but-"" I felt how my world crumbled around me, just as it did when I got rejected for the first time ever. And it hurt as shit. I havent been able to sleep for days, thinking what is it that I did wrong, thinking about the fact that in the future some fortunate fella will marry her and they will live a happy life which I will not be a part of while I rot here lonely and miserably,  and much more.

2. You push away girls that show interest in you, whether friendly or non-friendly
3. You avoid people(especially girls) that you aren't comfortable around but acquittanced with.
4. You prefer being in your room for long periods of time, but when you are forced to go out you unwillingly go, only to enjoy it most of the time?

ForeverAlone,"So a few months back, I meet this girl who I will call sue for the sake of this discussion. And Sue was someone that I would have thought would have been totally a great, long-term match for me. We had a ton in common, like a lot of the same things, could chat for hours and hours on end, had great physical chemistry. I totally could have given it a real go with her to make a life together. The thing was, she didn't feel like she could but did want to have some fun and fool around for a while. Best of all, she didn't believe our personalities were compatible. She was a bit more go with the flow whereas I have goals and plans to achieve them; she had a very dry and understated sense of ""humor"" that she felt I never got because I was too serious; she was more structured in her day to day whereas I was happy to work with a structure or go with the flow. I am sure there were other things she didn't like about me, but the point of interest here was that she liked certain things about me but not me. I got to hear the ""great guy"" speech again, and yet again have that crushing,  devastating, and all-around horrible feeling of rejection, and this time not because she thought we didn't work well together (we had a great time talking all the time and seeing each other a few times a week for months), but because she didn't like me. But what was different this time around, what made the difference and spurred on me writing this, was that something inside clicked, and after all these years, after all the different rejections for all the different reasons, good and bad, I finally came to this one realization and this one inescapable conclusion; some people are just don't have relationships.

Sometimes, some people just are who they are, they are not compatible with other people for whatever reason (current societal norms being different than their beliefs, personality not fitting with the image of the person for those around them, etc., etc.), and a relationship is not for them. I am a big fan of Myer &amp; Briggs Personality types and being an INTJ-T type of person. In the past, I tried to figure out what was the best solution to my problem here when it just is what it is. Whatever the combination, I am just not someone that this is an area of success for them. And that click, that eureka moment, lead to something rather unexpected. I had long dated towards finding a partner to share life with, not just jumping at the first chance of that, but that was at least the target. To finally arrive at a point where I didn't have to think about dating, and no longer had that gnawing desire for companionship. But here I was, heartbroken again, rejected again. Yeah, it hurt all over again, but it was the tipping point at which I finally connected the dots to what was going to be my way forward. I was just one of those people who would be alone, without someone to share life with, without the family (not that I wanted kids necessarily in the first place), and that's just how it was going to be. But now, what was liberating was that simply accepting this as my reality lifted a weight, much like when you have a secret you have been holding on to. You finally get to confess it to someone. And ironically, I had achieved my goal and gotten exactly what I wanted. And now, after a month of contemplation and reflection, I know I couldn't be happier. 

Since that click, I have dealt with the emotional aftermath of that rejection, and for me, in pretty record time. I have been able to look back at previous relationships as learning experiences that taught me lessons along the way to where I am. I am thinking up all the things and experiences I want to have that are hard to have when you have a partner around to think about. I am getting in better shape, picking back up things hobbies I had neglected, and reconnecting with friends with whom I had lost touch. Realizing that I was going to be alone and accepting that as simply a characteristic of who I am freed me more than I think I could have ever thought possible. Sure, I still have a gnawing desire for companionship, but it's diminishing over time. My point here and the reason I decided to share this story is to share a bit of hope, a perspective and acceptance that is contrary to society today, and to say that even if you are alone, and that alone time is forever, doesn't mean you have to be lonely. It doesn't mean you do not have a wonderful and incredible life that you get to enjoy all the same. Realize it as what it is, deal with its emotions, come to the point of acceptance of this being who you are, and just let all the emotional baggage and weight of it go so you can have your best life possible. :)",Forever Alone doesn't have to be forever lonely or forever aimless,Y5qdYCgxNkI5Wp32

it was a funeral of my close family i didn't go , because i knew she would be there i lied that i got covid.

i hope she forgets me. i don't deserve sweet love of teenagers.

ForeverAlone,"So I just turned 24 (not that old I know) but now I‚Äôm nearing my mid 20s. I‚Äôve realised that despite never having a girlfriend or anything else for that matter (khv) I really don‚Äôt find myself wanting a relationship. I grew up as a lonely child so I‚Äôm fairly used to being an independent person and living with my own thoughts.

I‚Äôm kind of in a situation where I‚Äôd be happy in a relationship but I‚Äôve lost the passion I once had towards the idea of finding one. I‚Äôm the only single person in my friend group and it used to really upset me but I‚Äôm finding acceptance (not peace) with it now that I‚Äôm nearing my mid twenties. 

I‚Äôve followed all the usual advice one my age receives: ‚Äújoin clubs‚Äù, ‚Äúbe yourself bro‚Äù, ‚Äúgo to the gym bro‚Äù, ‚Äújust talk to her bro‚Äù but none of it worked and I found I was in a negative feedback loop. I can‚Äôt say I‚Äôve found peace or contentment with my situation but I have accepted that I‚Äôll be single for a very long time if not most of my life. The pandemic is partly to blame for my recent lack of trying but I‚Äôve been off and off Tinder with limited success (a ghosting).

ForeverAlone,"Please do not tell me that I won‚Äôt be alone forever or that I‚Äôll find someone or make some friends; you do not know the extent of my introverted and reclusive personality. I do not enjoy myself when around other people; they drain me. I‚Äôve spent most of my life alone and I intend to continue on that way. 

I‚Äôve tried being optimistic, I‚Äôve tried improving upon my social skills, I‚Äôve tried meeting new people and conversing, but it‚Äôs futile. I enjoy myself the most when I am completely alone. Perhaps I‚Äôll get a dog... but other than that, I want to be alone. I can‚Äôt imagine what it‚Äôd be like living with another person; getting married; sleeping over at someone else‚Äôs house or doing literally anything with anyone; it drains the living shit out of me. I never enjoy myself. 

Ive spent so much of my life asking myself, ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs wrong with me?‚Äù. Why don‚Äôt I have any friends? Why does my brain fog and become hazy and my energy deplete so soon after engaging In social activity? Why can‚Äôt I enjoy the things that normal people do? Parties, sleep overs, hanging out, literally everything that normal people do. Too much worrying, too much to think about, too much to keep up with; I just want out and to recuperate in my bedroom where I feel the most happy. 

Although being alone is the only time I‚Äôm truly happy, I‚Äôve realized that there‚Äôs a terrible con to this extent of introversion. I‚Äôm going to miss out on a shit ton of human experiences that make life worth living and meaningful. I am. But what can I do. I tried living that life style, I tried attending a few parties and going over to peoples places; I tried being someone that I‚Äôm clearly not. I could be in Aruba sitting on a beach looking over the most beautiful ocean water and I still wouldn‚Äôt enjoy myself If there were other people there. I can‚Äôt be myself, I can‚Äôt do what I want; I feel pressured. Do I need to talk to a therapist? I really don‚Äôt think so. I really think I‚Äôm just going to spend the rest of my life alone in my home, never going out, never catching up with friends, never doing any of those sort of things. I fully expect to die a virgin, and if not, remain one until I‚Äôm like 30-40 years old. 

It was only a couple of months ago where I was suffering from post psychosis depression and the consequences of getting 2-3 hours of sleep for 6 months. I was yearning for a friend. I was longing for someone to talk to, anybody... but Ive gradually built myself back up and am able to get through this shit called life on my own again. I mean, honestly, it was only natural that I craved to talk to another human being; we are social creatures after all. I‚Äôd just come out of a 6 month episode where I practically didn‚Äôt talk to a single person and took to my diary for 7-11 hours everyday. Weird, I know. Psychosis was great fun. It‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm not going to converse or interact with people when I‚Äôm grocery shopping or when I‚Äôm at work, but other than that, I want no ties. I want to go back home, put on some lofi at whatever volume I want because I don‚Äôt have to worry about what anyone else thinks, and relax. I‚Äôll do what ever I want. When I‚Äôm around other people, I feel like I don‚Äôt have that option anymore. I just go with the flow and never enjoy myself.

ForeverAlone,"Yes, being an FA sucks.... but a fucked up relationship is worse.


So first let me introduce myself. I'm a 20 yrs old korean american living in Germany temporarly.


Let me tell you my first &amp; also my last relationship story.


So. Early November of 2020. I met this girl online on a dating app. She was very interested in me, but she was only 16, and was an extreme koreaboo. 2 red flags. We also lived pretty far away, like 150 miles apart. At first, I thought she was too young for me, which is very true. I should've ended there. But I was so desperate and she convinced me that it is very normal for 16 and 20 yrs old to date in Germany. Yes, it's an actual thing here.


So, we started our long distance relationship within a FUCKING WEEK. First month, it was great, but I always thought she was too young and never stopped feeling guilty.


 After the first month, my feelings for her slowly started to fade away. She was too young, didn't even respect my hobby, and was too much of a koreaboo. Then one day her parents found out she had a BF so they took away her phone. Yeah, for some reason, shes not allowed to date. So we'd literally text once a week when she secretly used her fucking phone.


So late January, I declared I was done with her. After we broke up, I didn't feel anything after. No regrets. Nothing. It was very clean.



Honestly, I'd rather stay single forever than date a fucking disgusting koreaboo. Plus, I felt so disgusted by myself for dating a fucking 16 yr old girl. 


Oh and we never met in real life just an FYI.",I should've stayed single forever.,dx40i
ForeverAlone,"So basically last year I was feeling a bit low. I really didn‚Äôt know how to become better since I had never faced this before. So I just started noting what activities I did and whom I did it with in a google doc. Slowly I also started rating how I felt about the interaction. Soon I started to notice a pattern that I felt better when I hung out with some people and when I did certain activities. This way I was able to feel much better than before and I gained confidence that I can control my own mental health. I even built an app for this so that other people can do the same. 

The app is called Happyer which was made based on the above experience and provides insights into impact of a given activity or friend.

People who say that looks don‚Äôt matter are straight up liars. The only reason they say that is because they probably never had to deal with being ugly in their life. I know that ugly people aren‚Äôt incapable of finding love, but it seems so difficult for me that I‚Äôm starting to doubt if I‚Äôll ever find anyone. I have tried all the dating apps (Tinder, Bumble, etc.) and I haven‚Äôt gotten a single match or like, not even one, and I swipe every day (until I run out of swipes because there‚Äôs no way I‚Äôm paying for any of these apps).

I seriously don‚Äôt know what to do anymore. I have barely any friends and the ones that I do have are all in relationships and are happy. I feel like the only reason they‚Äôre still friends with me is because they feel bad. 

I know some people are gonna say that ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt need to date someone to be happy‚Äù but that doesn‚Äôt apply to everyone. I grew up in a ‚Äútraditional‚Äù household with religious parents and they‚Äôve been implanting those values in my head since I was a kid. I don‚Äôt know anything else. My life just seems so empty and my mental state has tanked since I got out of college. I barely have any human contact since I work from home due to the pandemic. The only times I see my ‚Äúfriends‚Äù are when it‚Äôs a special occasion, otherwise they blow me off. The only reason I‚Äôm still ‚Äúfriends‚Äù with them is because I feel like I need them to prevent myself from falling into a deeper depression than I already am.

In other words ""I like you more than anyone else and every time spent with you lights up my day""

ForeverAlone,"To be held and hugged, to feel their warmth radiating through the air, to feel their calmness with you. 

It must be nice to cry on their arms and to be comforted when you've had a rough day, or to be missed and wanted rather than tolerated.

It must be nice seeing them messaging you first, them replying enthusiastically or for them to talk to you all day.

It must be nice laughing, giggling and wheezing over an inside joke and creating many more.

It must be nice not having to fake being happy. To just show how you feel. To open up to them without being afraid of who they're going to tell.

I‚Äôve been going through some really dark days. I sat down with a therapist the other day for an introductory meeting. I‚Äôm 25 and a classic KV (well maybe not kissless...I was in Italy once and did the kiss on the cheek greeting with a woman lol).

He asked me a number of perfunctory questions. Were you abused as a child? No. How is your relationship with your parents? Good. Have you ever been sexually assaulted or human trafficked? Negative.

It‚Äôs made me realize. I have torched my entire life. 

I sat in my dorm and made no effort to make friends or meet anyone in college. I‚Äôve never had the balls to even ask a woman out. I worked a dead end job I hated in an industry I hated for years, lost the job and now can‚Äôt find another job. 

I have great parents. I grew up well off in a nice house and they paid for my college (I hate bringing this up, but i‚Äôm being honest). I was bullied as a little kid but after that not really. I really don‚Äôt have enemies or anyone I hate, except for myself. 

I‚Äôm an average bland looking guy. Not much attractive about me but worse looking guys than me have gotten into relationships, that‚Äôs for sure. 

I have clinical depression, undiagnosed borderline autism and anxiety. But honestly I think like half the population probably does. As Ralph Fiennes says in In Bruges ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs suicidal. I‚Äôm suicidal. You‚Äôre suicidal. We‚Äôre all suicidal. But we don‚Äôt keep going on about it do we?‚Äù

People will say ‚Äúyou‚Äôre 25, it isnt too late‚Äù. But here I am trying my hardest to rebuild my life. I can‚Äôt find a permanent job after months of looking. No luck at all on the dating apps, not even a date. I‚Äôve even paid for them and worked hard on my profile. I‚Äôve tried therapy and getting new hobbies. Hasn‚Äôt helped.

I can‚Äôt help but wonder if I‚Äôd be in a better position if I had friends from college right now to cheer me up. Or didn‚Äôt make 1000 dumb career choices. Or never built connections. Or knew how to talk to women and had experienced rejections and the tribulations of relationships.

Just I need someone to be romantic and intimate with, you can't replicate that with friends or even FWB, but people always say the same! How you have to be happy alone and that if you don't like your own company why would anyone else?

But that isn't even true, take an extrovert and remove them from society completely, isolate them and they'll be miserable, you can fling all those shitty platitudes at them and it won't do jack shit because it just isn't who they are as people, not all of us can live up to some stoic ideal of complete social isolation being fine forever.

I may be introverted, but for me romance is just a need, just like sex is.

ForeverAlone,"I've been looking everywhere and tried everything within my reach. And i haven't been able to find one single thing worth fighting for..

Interests you say? I enjoy listening to music and playing on my guitar. That kept me happy for a long time, but now not even that brings me joy.

Animals? Yes i have cat's whom I love but even when they try to cheer me up my darkness consumes all happy thoughts like usual. 

Love? If i would be successful in it I'd might be able to find some temporary happiness or even long term happiness.
Im an 18M virgin and have never even got close to being in a relationship. Recently got friendzoned by the girl i loved very much.. my introvert shyness has F***ed every chance i have ever had. And rejection from your dream girl isn't exactly a mental boost..

Love yourself? Oh trust me i have tried many times.. but i find nothing to be proud of. All i see is a failed teen that has no chances at anything, i have decent grades but still not good enough. I have quite alot of talents and everytime someone decides that they wanna bond over one of those talents, my social skills completely obliterate every chance i get at making friends or partners. I'm better off being mute, or just existing somewhere far far away in some desolate mountain range somewhere..

""Friends"" i guess you could say i have some friends. But im always that Backup friend that nobody really wants to be with alone. Im just an extra, I only have 1 friend that i would consider to be my best one and im sure he'd say the same about me.. Hanging out with him and the other ones in the group is the only time i feel happy, and we rarely hang out...
And my declining mental state ruins my image more and more everytime we meet these days.. 

Long story short: Only time i feel happy is when im hanging out with friends.. 
and afterwards im left with my dark thoughts once again.
 And when you're a lonely person that requires neae constant company to function things are really difficult..

All my life, for as far back as i can possibly remember, i {M} have adored women. There has always been a special sense of comfort i‚Äôve felt with women and girls throughout my life. And, even being really young, i‚Äôve wanted to have a wife - a true partner, significant other, romantic relationship. But, while harboring this deep longing of mine, i have only ever been rejected. 25 years (believe me, i‚Äôve heard enough of the, ‚Äúyou‚Äôre still young‚Äù troupe - i‚Äôm sick of hearing it) and i still have no clue, at all, how to get a girl. i can ‚Äúbe myself‚Äù all day long with a girl, i can ‚Äúplay the game‚Äù, and even try out different approaches, but the result seems to always be the same - after a short while, i‚Äôm left ghosted and rejected, replaced by someone better.

ForeverAlone,"A little more than a year ago, I completely disconnected from everyone. I told my college friends that I died (sick, I know) and I got rid of my lifelong best friend. It was rough at first, but got easier with some time. 

Prior to ‚Äúkilling myself off‚Äù, I would describe myself as mildly depressed. My life sucked, my friends all laughed at my failures and wished me poverty, misery and general unhappiness. The moment I would have some hope in life or a fun business idea, they would be there to drag me back down by telling me that my ideas suck or that I better go get a ‚Äúreal job‚Äù or else I‚Äôm going to be poor forever...

Since ‚Äúkilling myself off‚Äù, my happiness level has dramatically improved! I finally started a successful (so far) business and am genuinely enjoying life. I contribute these life improvements to removing the toxins from my life. 

I no longer had anyone to bring me down. No one to tell me that my ideas are stupid. No one to stomp on the tiny bit of hope I had‚Äî just so they could feel better about their insecurities and miserable existence.

ForeverAlone,"Hello.

I am a 20 yo dude in college. I would like some advice on my situation or just your opinion so feel free to comment.

My college experience thus far has been pretty abysmal when it comes to the social aspect. I spent all of my freshman year at home (due to my program) and spoke to or met no one the entire year. I had pushed myself mentally to make it to my second year where I could move onto campus and finally attempt to get that social connection everyone makes such a big deal out of. As someone who was still a KHHV I had been longing for this chance and suffered greatly mentally to get to that point. 

Fast forward a few months and my life truly is still pathetic. I speak to no one during the week except maybe a thank you to the cashier.

I did meet a girl online and we met up in person once for lunch. Truth be told we basically have nothing in common and she is just not attractive (no offense to her she is nice but I wouldn‚Äôt date her due to a combination of issues). At this point we were just friends. Some time went by and I invited her over to watch some movies at my place. She wanted to cuddle and stuff which I just sorta agreed to because I wanted to badly (disregarding who it was). At the end of the night she asked if she could kiss me and I said she could on the cheek (again I‚Äôm not into her and do not want to progress this). We have sparsely talked since then as I‚Äôve been contemplating what exactly occurred and how I want to proceed.

I know this probably sounds like I have no problems with girls but that is far from true. I have yet to meet a girl who is mutually interested in me, nor have I ever been on a date.

Is it wrong for me to not count this experience as I see it as something I just did sorta out of haste rather than actually wanting to do so with this girl?",My situation (20M),Fussballspieler

I've been drifting in and out of my Depression these recent years. But a few weeks Ago i felt pretty hopeful again, well that was until ""love"" consumed me once again, i had completely given up my hopes of getting a GF, I'm too awkward i can rarely begin conversations with people.

Well so anyways a new girl joined my Class at school i didn't really think about it then, but after 2 weeks a friend of mine said that the new girl was interested in me, which blew me away, so she made us introduce ourselves and chat around, we really clicked we had the same interests and the same humor. So i began developing feelings for her..

But then my Awkward side started taking over bringing me back to my silent/shy stage, and now i feel as she's completely given up hope on me, she won't Begin conversations with me or barely acknowledge my existence.

ForeverAlone,"Hey, so I'm 16F and I'm a Disney Princess! Last spring, I started my own business and I regularly do story times for libraries and events for kids; it pays great and I LOVE my job. I worked so hard to get it started and I'm so happy with it. I've always been a Disney freak and it makes me so happy when the little kids smile and get excited to see their favorite princesses!

I'm also a hopeless romantic, with a love for romance novels and constantly dreaming about my Prince Charming. I've never had a boyfriend but I want one so bad...I've been interested in guys who didn't feel the same way or didn't feel the same way about guys interested in me.

So the connection...I often do photoshoots to promote my business! Over the summer, I did one on the beach as Ariel, a couple of days ago I did one in the snow as Elsa. They come out beautiful and I adore them, and since my job is such a love and big part of my life, I post them on my Instagram sometimes. I'm very clear about why I do it, but I know how much of a turnoff it is to guys. Even the ones who don't outright hate it are clearly rubbed the wrong way, and unless I totally hide it, I realize that no guy will ever want me as long as I do this. Guys think its weird, its childish, its not normal.

I've never been the typical ""I want her as my girlfriend"". I've come to love myself to the point where I think I'm pretty, and I say that purely out of self-love; my hair is shorter, I'm short, I'm not drop-dead gorgeous like models; I love to talk and can win any argument, I'm a wannabe lawyer and love to have fun, I listen almost exclusively to Taylor Swift, I put God first. I don't drink or vape or anything ""fun"". I'm just not what a guy envisions, ya know? I'm not an athlete, you won't find me at the hookup spots in my town. But the princess thing seems to be what really sets guys off. I pride myself on trying to be confident and myself no matter what I do, so I try not to be ashamed of the thing I love so much and share my joy with the world, but I realize its one or the other; as long as I'm doing this, I'll be single.

ForeverAlone,"It's been about 2 months since I lost my best friend of 8 years. It was stronger than a friendship to me. He was more than family or blood to me. I can never put into words how our relationship was to me. I always felt that I could not repay him, that if it weren't for him , I'd have gone crazy a long time ago. Don't worry, he is very much alive. You see , my life has always been filled with negative and unfortunate events. I am not the type to ask for help or to let the shitty things change me or effect my personality. But I do get depressed from time to time. Around August 2020, I started getting worried. He and I just could not stop arguing , over the dumbest things too. People kept saying we sounded or acted like a married couple and that was like adding fuel to the fire for him. He hated hearing that. The issue is , I am not the type of person who argues. I am just not good at explaining how I feel. Instead, I delete everything and I hide from everyone  and everything and I wait until its safe to return to the surface. We had another fight, at the end of October and I did just that. I already told him many times I can't argue with him, it hurts to get mad at someone I really care about. So instead I deleted all my social media, I turned my phone off and I stayed secluded for almost a month. I didn't want to ruin our relationship by saying something I didn't mean out of anger. At the same time , I just couldn't figure out why we was arguing all the time. He didn't take it too well. After the month he physically came to my house to get his things. Instead of talking to me, he told me that he didn't want to be friends with me anymore. That I just make his life stressful and that without me , he would have no drama in his life anymore. All I could do was hand him his things, and say ""you're right and I'm sorry I make you feel that way.""  I want nothing more than for him to be happy. Why does this hurt more than a breakup. Why is it so hard to stop caring. What hurts the most is thinking that he could pass away before I get to see or hear from him again. 8 years of talking to him all day every single day. Hundreds of pictures and videos I can't seem to delete. We have been through so much together , yet it feels like I'm the only one who cared. Our last interaction was terrible and I have to live with that forever. Out of all the things I have lost in 2020, this just about the worst. I hope that he succeeds in living the happy and drama free life he wants to live. I just have to accept that he can't do that with me in the picture.","Farewell my friend, Live in Peace",SneakySquidi
ForeverAlone,"Every year, my friendship size shrinks and every year, I figure that it's okay, because at least I have my closest friends. Difference this time round is that most of my friends have gone, moved away and are moving forward with their lives away from me. A couple stayed and I am grateful for them. Currently two of us are self-isolating after socialising for the first time with anyone for months (how unlucky right? It was also her birthday a couple days ago, so she had a pretty shitty birthday as well). Both the friends I have in the city are girls (I'm a guy), but it really is just that, we're friends. I'm also in a band with the other member being a girl too. I'm surrounded by girls and there's no feelings of attraction between any of us! I prefer it that way. I also do have a male friend, but I don't have much fondness for him. There are certain traits of his personality that are too strong, especially given that I have friends outside the city who I live who are the kind of people he hates.

It's maybe a bit unusual in this sub, but being forever alone isn't just about having a partner is it? I miss having a straight (or at least bi) male best friend. I miss talking about girls as we're walking down the street (Not creepily ogling at them as we walk past, talking about who we're talking to or who we're attracted to or whatever) and whatnot. I have male friends, but while two live in the same county as me, they're party animals! One who lives around 40 miles from me. It's hard to get up to him. I do like to talk about girls to him and he lives to talk about who he likes, but it's always on the phone. It's difficult for us to get to each other, particularly right now with lockdown (again) and another friend around 120 miles away. We usually end up speaking about the science of music and getting drunk though, which tbh, I do enjoy a lot, but even that's only a few times a year when I'm in the area. It's kinda sucky, I feel so disconnected from everyone right now because of the distance. I feel lonely.

I had a plan when I was younger. I always knew it might not go exactly to plan, but I didn't think it'd be like this. My last relationship ended in summer of 2015 (I was 22). It was partly a childish romance where we weren't sexual, we just kissed a lot (sometimes had a pretty good snog though) and it was filled with insecurities on both sides. I got over her fine, but my mental health was still so bad for the years following. I was supposed to have met a girl by now who I'd have fallen in love with. I was going to propose when I was 27 and we'd marry at 28 and potentially even have a baby around this time. As I said, I understand that things don't go to plan all the time, and this one was pretty much the type of thing that can't be planned meticulously, but to still be single and see no sign of actually finding love just stings a bit too much.",I'm 28 today.

ForeverAlone,"Got inspired to make this post since it's coming up to Chinese New Year soon. But I believe this is equally applicable to any race or religion that has an annual big holiday. So for Christians it'd be Christmas, for Chinese it'd be CNY, yada yada you get the point. 

Came across a Reddit post just now written as a rant about how to handle what they termed as ""nosy/intrusive"" questions during holiday season from family and relatives. Such questions basically including ""what are you doing now for work/do you have a dating partner yet/when you gonna have a baby/when you gonna get married/when you going to find a job/what you gonna study"" etc. 

I felt a twinge of sadness when I realised I could not empathise or relate to any of the questions.

Because during holiday season, I don't have relatives to visit, or visit me.

My family is the very definition of a nuclear family. Dad, Mum and me. All of my extended family on both maternal/paternal sides reside in another, and even before the pandemic we didn't go back to visit much, if at all because they're pretty much either distant or estranged from us.

So yeah. My holiday season is never bugged with such questions. 

And contrary to what most of you might think...

I kind of wish someone gave a shit to ask me such questions you all take so much effort to try and avoid. Because my parents sure as fuck don't give a fuck. 

I don't mind so much when they don't constantly bug me about when I'm going to find a job/what I want to do for a career. But it's hurtful in a backhanded manner when they don't seem to give a shit about their only child who's turning 28, and yet hasn't had a single successful relationship that lasted more than a year, and they don't even question why I don't have a girlfriend, or when I'll find someone. Like, I'm your son. Your only child. You don't care enough to even ask or tell me that you hope I meet someone right soon and settle down soon? You two spent more than a decade trying to conceive me after you got married, and yet you two are so laissez-faire about my lifelong happiness or luck in settling down with someone and having a kid in future when I'm rapidly reaching the age when my dad became a father to me... and I'm still single with no luck finding someone I'm mutually compatible to date and settle down with?

So yeah. Only child. No relatives or even parents giving a shit about my future happiness or happy ending with someone. To those who bitch about having to entertain such questions during holiday season, I hope you never have to experience the loneliness of no expectations or hopes for your life from people who are linked to you by blood.","I often listen to people bitching about how they have to entertain inane questions about careers/relationships during holiday seasons, and think ""you're lucky you even have anyone asking you stuff like that"".",DaybreaksBell93
ForeverAlone,"When I was younger I was confident and comfortable with myself. I was in a couple of relationships in my teen years but later on my mental illness has ruined my ability to date people. I was also bullied heavily and made to believe that i'm worth nothing because of mental issues.

I'm 24 now and the last time I was in a relationship was 7 or 8 years ago. I've been diagnosed with anxiety, OCD, depression, ADHD and Aspergers. I also have excessive sweating and digestive problems. 

Certain issues have made my quality of life very low and it feels almost impossible to date someone at this point. I've tried for a long time to deal with my issues with medication, exercise, therapy, eating healthy etc. These things help but I'm still constantly anxious and unable to live life the way I would like to.

I definitely would like to be in a relationship in the future but I honestly don't see myself ever getting well enough to be able to do that. A lot of people treat me like shit and my coworkers would always avoid me because of how anxious and awkward I am.

I had to quit my job a little while back because of how much stress and loneliness it was causing me. I know I'm still young and things can change but a strong part of me believes that i'm meant to be alone because of the way I am. 

I honestly prefer having a lot of alone time and not having to be around people constantly. However I still want the feeling of being intimate with someone, having someone in life that's always by my side to get through the good and the bad parts of life. 

I feel like I'm missing something but I just don't feel like I'm ever going to be mentally and physically well enough to be in a long term relationship and it really hurts to know that I may be alone for the rest of my life because of this.

I'm trying to make the best of this by spending time on hobbies that I enjoy like video games, drawing, hiking, gardening, cooking etc. I also see certain family members and friends every now and then so I don't feel completely lonely and some of them ask me about relationships.

Unfortunately, she has wanted kids for a very long time but is unable to have children of her own, which is definitely very tough for her, not too surprisingly. 

As for me, I'm the complete opposite of my sister in terms of romantic desirability. I was the 5 ft 2 scrawny kid with aspergers growing up so not too surprisingly, dating was on veteran level difficulty from the start. Puberty looked me and said ""sorry kid, here's the winning numbers to the genetic lottery, and you're way off the mark."" So as a result of my physical and social shortcoming, dating has always been incredibly difficult for me and is the main reason why i'm 25 years old and still single without any sort of dating experience. My gut feelings tell me that i'll still be a virgin who's never had a girlfriend before into my thirties and maybe even my forties; yes it's that bad.

So my mother will likely never grandchildren of her own, and I know this bothers her. All of my cousins are married and have kids of their own, but the same will likely never be said of our family.  The only ""kids"" i'll likely ever have is 10 cats.  I'll be the crazy cat man who lives next door.",My Mom Will Likely Never Have Grandchildren Of Her Own.,YeetroyJenkins

ForeverAlone,"Trapped between taking the time and effort to find someone (with the great plague making things harder, though there seems to be some light on the horizon with that at least), and taking the time and effort to have a life that would make me attractive to someone else in the first place.

Trapped between wanting to be real/myself, and wanting to research/do what it takes to put my best foot forward in a competitive scene and repress potentially weird traits that might turn off or scare off potential dates.

Trapped between not being able to love myself 100% because I've never found love or been loved, and (at least according to the status quo) not being able to find love or be loved because I don't love myself 100%.

ForeverAlone,"Yo just wanted to say that I finally was able to meet up with someone from Tinder a little while ago and now, long story short, I'm no longer a kissless virgin. Even somehow convinced my date to make out while watching a Bionicle movie of all things. 

Gonna admit though I was fucking awkward about it lol. Straight-up had to ask her consent and admit that I had no experience. Even though it threw her off she handled it surprisingly well. Probably because I tried to sound as chill as possible when I confessed and wasn't trying to guilt-trip her into it. 

I've also been making steps to improve my overall quality of life in general, and I kinda feel like I'm making progress. Still got a long way to go, though. There are deeper problems with myself that I still need to confront, and finally being able to make out with someone doesn't suddenly make those problems vanish into thin air. 

Not gonna forget my roots here, too. I realize I just got very lucky in this case. I think my sense of humor also gelled with hers a bit as well, but honestly I'm still shocked the whole thing didn't fall apart the moment I stepped foot into her apartment.

ForeverAlone," The first time I ever used Tinder was in the summer of 2015 when I was 20 years old. I remember signing up and being so excited. I read all these articles about how people were signing up for Tinder and getting laid or meeting their partner there and I thought the same thing was going to happen to me. Boy was I wrong.

When I first signed up for Tinder, at first I didn't get any matches because my pictures mostly consisted of bathroom selfies. But then about a week of using the app, I got an outside picture of me playing the guitar and also got several better pictures of myself. As a result, I started to get some matches with girls.

I would match with these girls and immediately fall in love with them and fantasize about having a life together, only to be completely devastated when I'd always get left on read. I would get left on read by every single girl I ever messaged on the app and I felt absolutely terrible as a result! It was this intense feeling of pain, dread, and hopelessness, and it was like this every single time I got rejected on the app. It didn't help that my friends would use Tinder and they were able to successfully get dates, while I couldn't even get one. As a result, it made me feel even more terrible, like there was something wrong with me. The final straw was when I matched with a girl, we exchanged snapchats, and she asked to see a picture of me, I sent a picture and then got blocked by her. This was the beginning of my downfall.

I then tried meeting women in real life. My thought process was that online dating was a waste of time for men and that surely real life dating would yield better results. So I spent the next several years trying to pursue women in real life, primarily through college. I talked to women in my classes and through the many clubs that I got involved with. I was rejected every single time.

Like any other person who's getting romantically rejected constantly, I wanted to know why; I wanted answers on why other people could find love while I was seemingly forced to suffer alone. At first, I learned more and more about how the world of online dating works. I learned that women hold all of the power in online dating and they have it considerably easier compared to men. This belief was further amplified when I signed up for Tinder as a girl only to get 100+ matches and have very little difficulty getting messages and dates.

But my real conclusion on why I couldn't find anybody to date was even more depressing. You see, I have obstacles in my life that make dating considerably more difficult than the average person. While everyone else was stepping over a crack, I was trying to climb over a mountain. I am a 5 ft 2 caucasian male which is well below average height, and being a short man, especially a man of my stature, is a disadvantage in the realm of dating. But that's not the only reason. I also have high functioning autism, which also makes dating considerably harder because autism itself impairs your ability to connect socially and emotionally with other people.

So in a nutshell, women don't want to date me because I am a 5 ft 2 autistic male, something I have 0% control over. I got fucked, screwed over, dealt a shitty hand, plain and simple. That's why i'm alone. If I were a 5 ft 10 neurotypical male, I would have had a girlfriend by now, maybe even be engaged or married by now.

I will admit that iv'e become more bitter over the years, I had to delete Facebook because of seeing all of those happy couples made me upset. I refuse to go to weddings either because that's something i'll likely never get to experience.

ForeverAlone,"So sick of hearing it. It comes off as generic, insincere and unimaginative. It just... doesn't help or bring anything new to the table, hearing that kind of stuff just makes me more pissed.

I'd rather be told the harsh truth. And that is: people (generally) are massive pricks, they don't care about you, or your good personality, they only care about the image of you. Your importance, your dominance, your status. Of course, I expect me saying this will be categorized as hate speech and generalization, but that's far from the truth. I am speaking from my experience (duh), and this just is my point of view.

I've been single for all my life, and although it's not the WORST thing ever to be single, it still makes you notice things other people wouldn't. You could be the best person in the world, literal Jesus, but if you don't have enough arrogance to push yourself, you'd be forever alone. Contrary, a literal arrogant prick with no value whatsoever can flow through relationships like it's nothing.

I don't understand it, but honestly, I've seen too much of it to think that's just a coincidence. Being alone doesn't make my blood boil, but that does, because there's absolutely no reason behind it. Of course, I don't think that's all there is too it. I'm not stupid, the world isn't black and white, but there is some truth to it.

He said he wants me to get a hotel for a month so we can hang out sometimes (in the city, not in the hotel).  I said yes because I don't exactly get any other opportunities to spend time with a guy.

But when I asked him if he could plan out some stuff for us to do there, he said I am entitled and that I don't appreciate his culture if I am so lazy I can't plan it myself.  He doesn't seem excited about my trip at all.

Also he never messages me first, saying he is busy.  He doesn't have a job either.  I am fairly certain he finds me physically unattractive due to other stuff he has said but part of me thinks maybe if I go on the trip, he'll realise I'm actually nice.

However it's causing me a lot of tension and stress to have feelings for someone who doesn't care about me.  What should I do?  Is it wrong to cut off a friendship when one party has feelings and the other doesn't even like you as a friend?",Would it be wrong if I stopped being a friend to someone who rejected me? It's negatively impacting my mental health,uncertaintey

ForeverAlone,"So, I'm a 27 male. I met this woman a couple of years back at my old job ( real shitty job). Years of talking on and off, I had decided to reconnect last year, right before the pandemic, just to see how she's been doing. We sort of just started talking every day. It really helped get us through this whole crisis, at least for me it did. We have become very close over the course of the past year, and aside from one night we were hanging out, we've mostly just been good friends. However, the closer we grew, the more I was hoping for something more, despite just being friends. Mind you, she moved to Brazil years ago, so there was no way of physically meeting up. Everything was going fine up until a couple of days ago when she started hooking up with some guy on tinder. How do I know? She fucking told me how amazing the sex was! I know we're good friends, but I really didn't need to know that. 

I'm so lost. She the only person I can really talk to, and she's been talking to me less and less. She suggested I try to do the same, but I'm not nearly as comfortable around people as she is. All I can think about lately is how one of the only people I care about is banging some dude she met on tinder in a completely different country!

I know it's irrational to be upset over a woman, I can't even physically be around, and I don't expect her to just swear off men for me, but it doesn't make this hurt any less.

ForeverAlone,"After 23 years with the only man I've had a relationship with (6 years older than me) I find myself alone. My partner threw me out for someone half my age. I was devastated and found myself cast out into a world I didn't belong in anymore. 

I moved cities (to Melbourne, Australia) hoping to escape the memories and eventually start a new life. But, Melbourne is a cold place filled with people who look down on middle aged men, especially a gay one. As a now single, middle aged man I find myself no longer accepted into the gay world looked upon as a predator or simply as a horse sent out to pasture. I've tried to make friends, straight people seem fine but gay men treat me like I'm a freak and generally disregard me completely. It's hard to make gay friends when all gay men want is sex and see you as ""old"" rather than their ultimate goal of bonking a hot, younger guy.

A few times I thought I struck up a friendship only to eventually have that person drop off the communication vine never to be heard from again or be told ""look you're really not my type, good luck"" I make it clear I'm not looking for a sexual relationship I'm just wanting to make some friends, be part of the gay world again. But apparently that's never to be.

If it is one type of situation that I do intentionally put my self in distress is listening to music. Something will happen where my mind seems to go from a high to deep in the muck of despair and music will keep me in that area.

I have playlists geared towards the mood I am in. Music that makes me think of failed romances wether they were legitimate or not. Music that reminds me of what once was, or the life I am living now.

ForeverAlone,"So, I've recently written this ''poem''

--

The violent fall, just like brutal sunlight burns my eyes

Old innocence becomes darkness, it's all haze

I long to explore the world but I can't leave my own maze

It is a long path to the shore, and I can't stand my self

Absence is frequent and it defines who I am

/


One is made of suffering, self at war

Use it to achieve, strain it always demands

Dauntless is no way to claim me

Cringing, shallow in my scattered essence

I seek endlessly and furiously.

/


 I carry on, all will abandoned, seeking unknown reason.

 My mind's slumber won't cease

 and I won't either, positively so.

 Venturing beyond hateful lands

 Must find chests hidden and packed.

/

Haunted by my ways, craving silence itself

miss what is now behind, chaos and flames not to be seen

 Bright and awful was the latest page, bringing bonds and weeping

 Alone still, devoid of fullness I stand

 Black eternal fills me with doubt.

/

On the endless road, I walk with none

My hands untouched and cold. Unmatched.

Avoid feelings which won't fill, at least I try

Faith in me I still search, gathering strenght 

Time machines were no fantasy, I would probably chase them.

/



Starry comfort I look at, must we be somewhere else?

Grasping the complexity in awe, barely grasp myself

Surface is what I know, numerical ways unreached

Comes a time where dryness reigns, drive is buried

If I never be me, at least light carries hope

/

Bound to habits, I drown in hope still

In friendship, haven and warmth uncovered

Guilt is often found but to dwell brings only harm

Stone way ahead, wings in abscence

Meaning, joy, dreams, at the finish line


/

Painless nearly, in glimpse only hurt

To be held, constant thought consumes me

Anatomy overflows, yet alone fails

Rooftop unseen, the longing goes on

Feeling in life, a requirement it takes after

/

Awareness deceitful, in faith reigns doubt

Eiffel desires, a loved one awaits

Yet to seize I fail, always unfull

Liquid escape, so rapidly fades

Tangle aside, I crave love and meaning

/

In absence, fullness hides itself

The unharmed routine slithers rapidly 

There comes a new number. Hope appears, abstract and fragile

In wait of a touch, meaning, green grass

Never craving final darkness, guilt finds me for not escaping

/

Easily down, only a whimper is heard

Hindered by my own, I shall always refuse

At words, devoid of any complexity I stand

ForeverAlone,"[The original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAlone/comments/ks4mle/notes_from_trying_dating_apps_again/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf).

So I did what I said...for the most part. I deleted Tinder and Bumble. I decided to keep Hinge however. There was a small part of my brain thinking the match I had exchanged a few more than a dozen or so messages with would hit me back. She hadn‚Äôt responded in three days, but she was slow to respond in general. I figured every other match was dead. 

I‚Äôll be honest. I was crazy about this girl. She had all the same interests as me. She even laughed at some of my messages. She was very pretty and kind of out of my league (I mean who isn‚Äôt these days) but certainly not the instagram model or sorority bombshell type. She had liked my picture first, actually.

As background I have severe anxiety and moderate depression that I bottle up. No one outside anonymous internet strangers knows.

Now for the pathetic part: I started to think this was my soul mate. Honestly, this might be the most flirting I have ever done with a woman; in my 25 years on earth, I had never even asked a girl out. I thought my first date ever would be the one I marry. She had apologized for taking a while to respond even at one point, which made the comedown even harder. She had a habit of responding late at night. How well I slept every night depended on whether she responded. 3 days became 5 days. 5 days became a week. I sent a last ditch message last night. I‚Äôd die happy if she responded, but the odds are obviously slim at best. 

Here‚Äôs the point I want to drive home. A normal person would quickly move on. They might not even bother checking Hinge outside every few days. They‚Äôd forget about her within a few hours. And I am sure this is how she‚Äôs thinking - maybe she‚Äôs even been on a date with someone else since then. I‚Äôm dating app guy #679 to her - like a dry cleaning ticket. 

Now this isn‚Äôt all of us, but I think some people here are at risk. For those suffering from loneliness, from mental ailments, you take any attention or affection you can get and make it into something it isn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs like a man dying of thirst thinking a droplet of water is like a full bottle. It can be seriously damaging. This is especially true as the world is in a damn pandemic.

I‚Äôd seriously reconsider joining these dating apps unless you are in a somewhat stable mental state and have things that can distract you (idk maybe if you‚Äôre working 14 hour days the apps are on the backburner). Getting half a pinky toe out the door of forever alone and getting pulled back in is often worse than staying put. 

I had my first anxiety attack in 2 months. I‚Äôve spent an hour or so each day moping, napping, and crying in bed in the afternoon (I work from home due to covid). My roommates (whom are new and whom I barely know) have asked if I‚Äôm ok because I look so down around the apartment. My parents visited me recently and I put on my best face. My mom texted me after, thanking me for joining them and said ‚Äúyou seem great‚Äù.

ForeverAlone," 

I meant to post this here first, because a lot of the posts here resonated with me - but I couldn't because I didn't have enough comment karma. Sometimes I read a post and it's just what i've been thinking for so long, almost verbatim. So I thought I'd post this here and hopefully find someone nearby so we can be a little less alone:

Hey world! I am a 23 year old Ontarian bean looking for someone to invest in :3 I'm down to talk to people anywhere and everywhere (if you're ranty and spammy enough, I'll definitely be down to talk to you), but I am primarily looking for Ontario beans! I have been penpalling for a long time and I just want to get to know people who are closer by, hell I'd be down to even meet up way down the road if you aren't super serial killer-y

Things that ensure we will mesh:

\- You are a wholesome bean who is comfortable oversharing, and sometimes receiving oversharing. Well 'oversharing' is generally the word people use when they first start to open up a little, but I just mean I want a deeper relationship than just shallow small talk. I love talking about our lives and the things we're looking forwards to, or hell even dreading - honestly, some of my happiest penpalling moments are when i manage to brighten up the dark days of a bean i'm writing to, and sometimes vice versa which is nice too.

\- You want platonic but close friendships! I try to keep things as anonymous as possible in pursuit of this. I know no matter what I say here i will get creeps and one word messages and low effort responses, but I can limit the people who are just looking for someone to smash, and i won't be overwhelmed by a bunch of responses from people who are just being creepy. I find maybe a couple close beans every time i post on here, and we always end up watching movies together, others i talk to throughout the day sending memes and other inane nonsense, and sometimes we game together (I got a ps5!). Not off the bat obviously, but something to work up to if you're into that sort of thing.

\- You are a spammy rambly machine!!! I love it when people can just go on about their day or what they want to do or their plans. I'm sort of the same way, and i love it when i meet another spammer and we can just snowball into different conversations block by block.

ForeverAlone,"I meant to post this here first, because a lot of the posts here resonated with me - but I couldn't because I didn't have enough comment karma. Sometimes I read a post and it's just what i've been thinking for so long, almost verbatim. So I thought I'd post this here and hopefully find someone nearby so we can be a little less alone: 

Hey world! I am a 23 year old Ontarian bean looking for someone to invest in :3 I'm down to talk to people anywhere and everywhere (if you're ranty and spammy enough, I'll definitely be down to talk to you), but I am primarily looking for Ontario beans! I have been penpalling for a long time and I just want to get to know people who are closer by, hell I'd be down to even meet up way down the road if you aren't super serial killer-y

Things that ensure we will mesh:

\- You are a  wholesome bean who is comfortable oversharing, and sometimes receiving oversharing. Well 'oversharing' is generally the word people use when they first start to open up a little, but I just mean I want a deeper relationship than just shallow small talk. I love talking about our lives and the things we're looking forwards to, or hell even dreading - honestly, some of my happiest penpalling moments are when i manage to brighten up the dark days of a bean i'm writing to, and sometimes vice versa which is nice too.

\- You want platonic but close friendships! I try to keep things as anonymous as possible in pursuit of this. I know no matter what I say here i will get creeps and one word messages and low effort responses, but I can limit the people who are just looking for someone to smash, and i won't be overwhelmed by a bunch of responses from people who are just being creepy. I find maybe a couple close beans every time i post on here, and we always end up watching movies together, others i talk to throughout the day sending memes and other inane nonsense, and sometimes we game together (I got a ps5!). Not off the bat obviously, but something to work up to if you're into that sort of thing.

\- You are a spammy rambly machine!!! I love it when people can just go on about their day or what they want to do or their plans. I'm sort of the same way, and i love it when i meet another spammer and we can just snowball into different conversations block by block.

Ok so I went on the second date yesterday. We decided to go to an art museum. We met up at the same time and walked all around the place for like an hour. It was nice and pleasant, and she let me nerd out about all the stuff I remember from art school lol. But the cafe there that we were going to eat at was closed because of covid. When I asked her if she wanted to eat somewhere else, she mentioned that she actually just bought the ingredients for Shepard‚Äôs pie, and asked if I wanted to come to her house to help make it. Both of us enjoy cooking so of course I said yes, and we headed over there. 

I felt a bit of nervousness cuz y‚Äôknow... I‚Äôm a guy going to a date‚Äôs house, so maybe.... something might happen??? We got to her place and cooked it together which was actually really fun! And we talked a lot about random stuff as we ate. Then afterwards we got on her couch together and watched a movie. I haven‚Äôt really broken the touch barrier yet, so I tried siting pretty close to her. 

We watched Parasite then watched the first couple Wandavision episodes. I chose a suspenseful movie so maybe... she might lean into me more like in the movies lol. It sorta kinda worked lol. We were just shoulder to shoulder at a few points. Things actually never really got too flirty, but I still had a good time! We first met at 2 and I ended up not leaving till nearly 10pm! I spent the whole day with her! I gave her a big full on hug, and called it a night. 

So that‚Äôs my second date. And we‚Äôve already made plans to meet up next weekend. So far it feels more like hanging with a friend than a date. That‚Äôs not a bad thing at all, but nothing ‚Äúromantic‚Äù has happened yet. I‚Äôm in no rush or anything but I don‚Äôt wanna be ‚Äúfriend zoned‚Äù either, and we‚Äôve been keeping things very friendly so far.

ForeverAlone,"(This post might contain TMI - you have been warned)

I'm 22M and a kh virgin and on top of that suffer from an extremely high libido, I am constantly aroused and thinking about sex, from the moment I wake up to when I go to sleep my entire life revolves around sexuality. This started as early as I can remember, when I was 10 I would jerk off about 20 times a day and constantly roam the house looking for makeshift 'toys', basically anything that could remotely work.

I'm bi so i'm attracted to a lot of people which made going through middleschool and highschool hell, and college isn't any easier now. And since I can't really satisfy these urges I started exploring all sorts of kinks and sexual deviancy from there.

It never went away or even slowed down, only got worse. I am depressed on and off on a weekly basis practically, it usually triggers when I watch/read something sexual and realize I can't have it. Then the next week I will be extremely hyper and daydream 24/7 about extremely vivid and elaborate fantasies, often not touching myself for days.

 I never watch any kind of porn, usually I don't need anything but thoughts to get me off, and regular pornography does absolutely nothing. I have practically every fetish in existence, and even the ones I think I don't, I can see myself being into them eventually. I can't even call them fetishes and I don't think I'm genuinely interested in many of these things, but just about anything could in theory provoke arousal, even if just for the fact it is odd and taboo. 

I have gotten off to humans, animals, plants, fictional characters, mythological beings, demons, angels, aliens, objects, ideas, feelings, bodyparts, songs, poetry, art and pretty much anything you can think of. 

Sometimes after I get out of a depressive episode I realize I developed a new fetish spontaneously, and it becomes an obsession that keeps me going for a while.

ForeverAlone,"I'm nearly 18, male. I have basically no friends. I have no girlfriend. I'm a virgin (most people my age aren't, or at least, in my school). I've never been invited to anything.

I had a girlfriend earlier this year - we didn't even last two months. She was acting in a racist manner, and i pulled her up on it and she pulled the plug. I'm over her now, but i miss having someone in my life so much. 

That was my only girlfriend. Before then, there was no one. I've always been the subject of people taking the piss out of me around girls - girls say someone likes me and they don't. Only one girl has asked me out - I actually asked my gf out not the other way round. This happened a month or two before me and my gf met. There was this girl from school, when I first saw her, I thought she was like 13/14. Found out she was a bit younger. i admitted i found her attractive, then a month later she askeed me out. having established she wasn't even 13 yet, a couple of months off (not sure what stage i knew this, i feel so bad for this), i said no. she wanted to know if id do sexual stuff with her and i said no. so the only girl to ask me out was this fucked up 12/13 year old who probably just wanted an older guy for sex. I actualy felt like it was a dilemma at the time, i didn't want her for sex, iw as so fucking lonely i considered even just saying yes just so i could at least say i had a gf. ive becoming fixated with this event with my depression, and one of the things ive always struggled with is this around girls, but its weird cos i often find girls easier to talk to. online, at least. anyone else cna relate? im worried i might not get into university next year, and my opportunnities for making relationships etc will be significantly reduced. Is the problem cos im not attractive? i can send a picture. personality? im sick of living my life alone. ive been told today the way i pose in my pictures makes me look gay, ive had more guys either on reddit or elsewhere ask me out than girls lol.

Surely some of you have noticed how quickly you judge a person by their appearance or how ""hot"" they are. How you put more effort interacting with people who you think are attractive. And that's natural I suppose.

My mother joined the Seventh day adventist (SDA) Church when I was young and me and my siblings were ""asked"" to join as she felt it aligned more with her religious beliefs. I went ""willingly"" untill my early twenties then stopped. She was a good mom and stuff but I never felt she made the effort to build an emotional home. I feel like the amount of work she put in came at a cost of her own happiness which made her have very little emotional patience, including the churches out on life which seemed very judgemental. 

I could speak to my dad about some emotionally things  but he was still a man from a time when men don't wanna talk about those things. He passed away in my late twenties so I have felt severely emotionally lonely since then. I've noticed whenever I like a girl I tend to over share my feels and thoughts as I feel I've been deprived of that throughout my child hood.

ForeverAlone,"
Hi, I have posted a couple of times on here about my behaviour and how I want to change.  But now I have a few follow-up questions. 

Context:

I am in my early 20s, I am gay and was raised very Christian. I was bullied in high school because of being gay. I have a good group of supportive friends. I suffer from OCD symptoms and have been diagnosed with anxiety. I am also a catfish.

Basically, on and off for about 18 months I used a fake profile to talk to men on Grindr. The nudes I sent were my real ones but the face photos were not mine. The chats were often sexual, but I never shared any photos or chats with anyone else. I blocked everyone very quickly - often after a few hours, the longest was probably around a week. 

I used the fake profiles because I didn‚Äôt want to be found out as gay or have my face connected to my nudes. I wanted to be invisible but I also wanted to talk to men (it‚Äôs pathetic, I know).

My Realisation:

I stopped using this fake profile and deleted all accounts/chats/photos in September. But the guilt and realisation of what I was doing really hit in late October and has been severe since then.

I deeply regret that I‚Äôve violated people like this - lying to them and deceiving them, especially because of the sexual nature of the chats. Even though I didn‚Äôt blackmail or share the nudes/chats anywhere, I feel disgusting and deeply regret that I‚Äôve lied to people to even have those conversations in the first place. The idea that someone has been hurt by my actions is very troubling to me and I wish I could go back and stop myself from behaving in this way. I never intended to cause harm or violate anyone - but I now know that‚Äôs exactly what I‚Äôve done since the harm was in my lying and deceiving. There‚Äôs still wrong been caused by actions even if the people didn‚Äôt realise they were being catfished. 

Where I need advice: 

Since I stopped using the fake profile I‚Äôve been seeing a therapist (for CBT and Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, to help with my OCD/Anxiety and to help me act on my values not my fears) and a counsellor too. I‚Äôm trying to stop watching porn and have been reconnecting with my Christian faith. However, I am unsure how to atone and make up for what I did. I know I can‚Äôt change the past, but I want to be better in the future and not behave like this again. What does accountability look like for someone in my shoes - what is the right thing to do from a moral perspective?

In previous posts I‚Äôve made about this situation, people have advised me to not seek out the people I talked to on the fake profile to apologise to them. I believe this is because the people I was talking to likely weren‚Äôt forming romantic feelings nor were they likely aware I wasn‚Äôt who I said I was. This has left me with a few questions however:

1. Is it really okay to just move on and leave this in the past? To me it feels like something I deserve punishment for and like I owe many people an apology. But I also don‚Äôt want any apology I give to re-victimise or victimise anyone, especially if they didn‚Äôt know they were being catfished. I also don‚Äôt know if any apology would even help the situation here?

2. Do I need to tell my close friends/flatmates now about my behaviour? If your friend had been doing what I‚Äôve done, what you want them to do to atone/make up for it.

3. Do I need to tell future lovers/boyfriends? I hate the idea that if at some point in the future people find out I was catfishing, that my boyfriend/husband/future kids would get dragged into the situation too. How would I go about telling a future partner? Or even if it was not my catfishing but my nudes that got found out (since the nudes were my real ones).

4. Is it okay to wait for someone I talked to find out it was me who catfished them or should I find the people I talked to and tell them it was me. I know what I‚Äôve done was wrong and so should I seek out the people I‚Äôve wrong to right the situation or will that cause them more harm? Like I don‚Äôt want to be projecting my own guilt onto them. 

5. This connects to the first question. I feel like predator and a monster - particularly because of the sexual nature of the chats. But I also have anxiety and OCD. This makes it hard for me to judge this situation objectively. I feel so disgusting and guilty - but people on other posts have said that my guilt is making me view this situation as worse than it is. Please tell me what your first reaction to my situation is. 

Basically, I just want to know what steps I can take to be better in the future, now that I‚Äôve stopped Catfishing. I don‚Äôt want to be that person anymore - I want to contribute to the world and I want to make people happy and have a family - I just don‚Äôt know how to get there or if I even deserve that.  

Tl;dr - I was a catfish (used fake profile on Grindr) and often had sexual chats with people. I‚Äôve now stopped but what steps can I take to be better in the future. I want to change.",I need some advice - tldr at the end,sadthrowaway0001

ForeverAlone,"Except when women say they're attracted to a guy's personality, they don't realize a man's look's ARE his personality. Tall and Attractive = Confident. Short and Ugly = Awkward. EVERY TIME. People's perceptions of a person will always be skewed to the point that their interactions will force the person to naturaly adopt the expected behaviour as a learned, feedback, adaptive strategy. Acting outside of those expectations as an unnattractive male will make people uneasy, they'll seem ""Weird, tryhard"". By contrast an attractive male will make it seem acceptable, ""Unique, spontaneous"" women will always overlook such things and male friends will find it amusing or cool behaviour, enough that they themselves may even emulate. On that last part, any unnattractive male in the group attempting to emulate chad's ideosyncratic behaviour will still seem tryhard even if it's exactly the same. Every. Fucking. Time. 

In this sense, the halo effect isn't just a perceived positive personality for attractive people, it's a perceived and LIFELONG-REINFORCED personality.

Other instances of haloed behaviour, an introverted, solitary attractive guy is considered ""mysterious"", an introverted, solitary incel is ""A creepy loner, awkward aspie etc"". The Halo effect is brutal. When it comes to a loud and outgoing attractive, they're percieved as fun, interesting, the life of the party, possessing a ""Good Personality"". A loud unnattractive guy doing the same thing will be percieved as obnoxious, boring and try-hard. Nothing they actually say matters, only who says it, the way they say it and whether they're attractive or not. Other Haloing factors come into play as well, such as physical presence, dominance which also more strongly influence interactions with other men, these are often due to a combination of facial features, frame size, muscle (Changeable), voice and posturing (Also changeable, but comes more naturally to those conditioned by years of constant validation from their looks).Ôªø",Girls love guys for their personality,barryjordan586

I really like girly girls and valley girls. I dont know why but it has always attracted me. Ive always thought my attraction was weird, but now I think, whats to lose? I either get exactly what Im looking for or excactly what Im looking for + extra points, surely worth a try right?

I dont know why but Ive always found these types of girls most attractive to me, girls who love dresses and skirts, makeup, nails and heels. It just makes me happy seeing a girl that takes passion in these things. I love it when girls talk about their fashion, I dont get it, but it makes her happy, so it makes me happy.

I just suffer with conditions (depression, anxiety, schizophrenia) and I suppose having someone all cutesy, bubbly and uplifting will make all the difference in my life. So message me and tell me about your latest lip gloss or how you styled your hair, most guys hate it but I love it, it attratcts me. Theres no point me wondering why it does, I should just accept it and find a girl who makes me happy and I hope to make her happy to.

On the other side of the spectrum I really like emo/goth/scene girls. Its cute, evil and fun. I love the crazy hair and piercings. And plus their humour is more on parr with my humour style too. I like the big boots, crazy clothes and obviously the music. Why dont we make Monster guns together whilst rocking out to crazy loud music? Maybe we could duet together??? Just sayin'

And I suppose in the nutural middle I love tomboys andcountry girls. Show me your horses. Can I please poke them? Do you have access to a sheep i can poke? I just wanna poke a sheep but all the wild ones dont want it, and those in captivity judge you like crazy for poking them. Or maybe we can sit in trees? Ill bring my acoustic guitar and sing sweet melancholy whilst you sit in the tree gazing at the sky.

ForeverAlone,"Sure, I may be able to find a woman someday, but even then I feel like she won't truly love me for me, but only for something that I bring to the relationship, such as a good job, good money (which I don't currently have), or an increased social status. Every single person wants these things, and strives to attain them. But there's a staggering difference in the effects of having or not having them between more and less attractive people.

It feels like if you're attractive, you don't *have* to have any education, or money, or artificially acquired status. Your face is your business card. It alone means that people will look up to you and treat you with respect, and women will go after you or at least not reject you when you go after them. The rest quite literally doesn't matter. It doesn't matter if you're a drug addict without a job, living on government assistance. Your face will do the talking and the girls will follow. People won't be so quick to judge you either. That doesn't mean that you shouldn't pursue an education or a career, or that having those things won't put the already attractive guy in an even better situation, but what I'm getting at is that it isn't absolutely essential. You already have value that is tied to your face, and barring some disfiguring accident or illness that value cannot be taken away, no matter what.

And then you have the unattractive guy. Unattractive guys seem to have very little intrinsic value. It's almost like by holding down a job and contributing to society, you're constantly trying to explain why society should even tolerate you. And remember what I said about how good-looking guys get treated even if they haven't got their lives 100% in order? If you're unattractive and unemployed, poor, etc., you're treated like junk. It's almost like you might as well not exist. And when you do get a job and start doing better financially, it's like you always know that any respect you are given is purely due to your position, not because they respect you deep-down as a person. And if you ever lose your acquired ""status"" all that respect will simply evaporate. 

One of the most painful areas where this applies is love and romance. I had a realization a while back ablut how the experience of losing one's job is different for attractive and unattractive men. If an attractive man in a stable relationship loses his job, he usually thinks ""How am I going to provide for my wife and kids?"" ""How am I going to prevent us from selling the house?"" ""How do I keep my kids happy?"" At no point does he worry about his wife leaving, in fact the thought probably never crosses his mind because he knows she loves him for something other than his money.

Then you have the average guy who loses his job and does start to worry about how he will tell his wife and how she will react if she finds out. And then finally you have the unattractive guy, in whose case it is often clear not only to himself but to the people around him, that if he's poor or unemployed for any extended period of time, his marriage is toast. This is almost never said in such a clear way, but it's heavily implied and people just instinctively know it. 

The moment I had this realization was a few months back when I watched a movie, whose title I can't remember or even the plot, but the one scene that stuck with me was when a relatively unattractive, maybe low-average guy was involved in some sort of accident where he sustained a broken femur and there was no guarantee he'd be able to return to work. At one point his colleague, whom he was not on very good terms with came to visit him in the hospital. They quickly got into another argument and the other guy just leaned over and got right in his face and said ""What about your wife, though? You think she doesn't have any other options? You really think she'll want to stick around a loser who can't even work?"" The moment that scene occurred, I couldn't help but think how things would be different if the guy had been more attractive. His colleague probably wouldn't have said that and even if he did, it wouldn't pack as much punch because it'd be far less likely to be true.

I‚Äôm too shy and not confident enough to be able to just walk up to someone I like and put myself out there like you normally would and I‚Äôve been SOL on dating apps too.

ForeverAlone,"Depression is the hardest thing I deal with on a day to day basis. Im sat here without any motivation, without any hope, and all I wanna do is curl up in bed and pretend to be dead, but I cant, because I did that earlier. I would be doing everyone a lot of favours if I just curled up and died, I feel it would be good. I really dont matter, Im unlovable. 

Im the broken toy your dad cant fix, im the one sock with a hole in it, that bear you left at a beach when you were 7 and cant remember. Im disposable, unfixable and replaceable. Im a pain in everyones backside, good for nothing and I just cause issues. I feel like a waste of space, although I dont deserve the air I breathe.

I want to matter, and I want to feel like I should and can. But my mind takes me back to the yelling, the hitting, all the things that were said to make me believe I was the one at fault, like these mistakes were mine and not my abusers. I think back to school and all the times I was bullied, laughed at, strangled. The amount of jokes I was the subject of. 

I think back to visiting my nan, my abusive father would go off with her in the kitchen and me and my sister would sit in the living room and she would start hitting me, kicking me, pushing me onto the floor. I would always leave so heavily bruised. And if I dared to even think of telling on her I would be told Im trying to ruin his day with his mum, and my sister would hit me 10 times harder next time.

My oh so perfect sister who could never put a foot wrong. Everyones favourite child. Everyone always gave her attention, always such positive affirmations and I was told to shut up and sit in the corner. I was always the mistake, I was always told I was. My mother just reconfirms what my father said. She hasnt seen my sister since 2015 and I swear she would so much more prefer it was me she couldnt see anymore.

And dare I bring up my depression, anxiety or schizophrenia. God no. Im just moaning, its normal, I should just cope with it alone. Dont take the pills they give you, they'll make your head blow up, or even worse theyll make you fat. I swear thats all any of them care about is how they look, their stupid fucking reputations. It drives me insane. 

For nearly 20 years I have had to push down these feelings of depression, anxiety, not mention the things I hear or see. Not tell anyone I self harmed, or tried to kill myself. No no, because if anyone overheard me say it, how would that make her look? Its only now Im away from them all Im able to breathe a little. But really, is this fight even worth it? What am i even fighting for? I dont have anyone, no love or friends, just me. Why should I fight? What do I have worth staying for? One thing Ive learnt is depression doesnt go away, so I wont be fighting to have a clear head, or happy thoughts. 

Most people have someone to fight for. They fight for their partner, their best friend, their parents, their cat, their brother or sister, daughter, son. But I dont have anything.

ForeverAlone,"Hello all, my first time posting! Though reading through other people's honest and thoughtful posts is very heart-wrenching, and I appreciate this community a lot. I would like to vent a bit too. I am young woman in her late 20s, who has never had a boyfriend. I recently decided to re-read a journal I kept in high school, which spanned my sophomore and junior years. There was one constant thread that ran through it that just crushed me - I had multiple entries where I would note a boy had suddenly started messaging / texting me more, and I could read the giddy little tone that I was excited this person might ""like like"" me. And then, a few weeks later, an entry expressing dismay that that boy just told me he had a massive crush on my friend (often the same friend). There was also specifically one boy who messaged me every day and always hung out with me in school, who over the course of 2 years went from crushing on one of my friends, to another (I also read a journal entry about a Valentine's Day in which he gave a Valentine to his crush and then around 6 of his other female friends, but not me.) This happened with about 6 different boys, and even though it was all more than a decade ago, I felt that gnawing feeling inside all over again, as if it were yesterday. I guess, because, it feels like it has continued to happen that way, even long into my adult life. In college, there were many guys who became my friend solely to seek emotional support as they had a break-up / had a crush on someone else (not even like we were friends prior, but suddenly reaching out). I consider myself a pretty friendly, sociable person, and maybe that is why guys feel comfortable with me? But I feel like I'm at a loss for what to do if I actually want someone to be with ME? I don't know, I guess I am just rambling.

ForeverAlone,"Hi everyone.

I have a very surreal situation that I just have to get off my chest. 

Sorry for the incoming wall of text.

I'm a 34 yr old FA virgin. I've experienced severe trauma throughout my life, and as a result I'm currently a shut-in who has zero social life. I also work night shifts in order to avoid people as much as possible.

Like a lot of men on this subreddit, I experience severe anxiety whenever I'm around women that I'm attracted to. The more I'm attracted to the woman, the worse my anxiety gets.

As luck would have it: around 2 years ago an absolute stunner started working at my company. To describe her, she's basically exactly ""my type"": petite, pale white skin, very pretty face, alluring dark hair. She also happens to have insanely beautiful hazel eyes.

This woman ended up working shifts which put her &amp; I in close proximity with each other on a nightly basis.

As you might be able to guess: this arrangement was hell for me. Everytime I was ever around her my anxiety would jump to a 10/10. I did my best to be cordial &amp; professional with her, but oftentimes I would simply freeze up &amp; make an ass out of myself.

My impression of her in the beginning was that she could tell that she made me feel anxious, and so as a result she attempted to be friendly with me in a way that implicitly suggested something like *""hey, I don't bite. chill out bro.""* Unfortunately her efforts didn't alleviated my symptoms very much at all.

Things started to turn for the worse after the first couple of months. Hazel Eyes stopped being friendly with me in any capacity. She started keeping a permanent scowl on her face whenever she was around me which seemed to scream *""stay the fuck away from me.""*

She'd never acknowledge me at all on the few occasions when I *was* able to muster something as simple as *""hi, how are you"".*

She was pretty much giving me an absolute cold shoulder‚Äîwhich completely shattered my already non-existent self-esteem.

My assumption at the time was that she must have been some typical conceited *hot girl* who had simply grown tired of trying to humor me. I figured *my* discomfort had started making her feel uncomfortable, but instead of taking the so-called high road, she opted to vent her frustration by being purposefully malicious towards me.

I put up with this behavior from her for a long time. Like.. for a good year. But eventually I reached my breaking point.

I knew that I had never been anything but cordial &amp; respectful towards her. I knew that I didn't deserve to be treated the way she had been treating me.

Ultimately I decided to grow a backbone &amp; start behaving the exact same way she had been behaving towards me.

Long story short: my new mode of behavior seemed to pay off. She modified her work schedule pretty soon afterwards. I started seeing a lot less of her after that.

Fast forward to around 5 weeks ago, when the most surreal thing imaginable started happening: Hazel Eyes herself started initiating (friendly) contact with me.  :D

It started with her approaching me out of the blue to tell me that she had done this or that unsolicited favor for me, which has since progressed into her &amp; I making small talk whenever we run into each other.

Through this small talk I've been able to learn that she's actually experienced a fair bit of trauma in her own life. She had been raised in a religious fundamentalist household, she was married off as a teen (which ended in a messy divorce a few years later), etc.

The crazy thing is that now *she* is the incredibly shy one whenever we interact: I have no problem with keeping eye contact with her, but Hazel Eyes really really struggles with it. Honestly I find it adorable.

This will be hard for me to explain or justify in text, but I've had a strong inclination since the day she first approached me that she has some kind of crush on me. This inclination has only grown as the weeks have progressed.

In retrospect I think there could very likely be some kind of alternate explanation for why she was so rude to me in the past. I suspect we must have somehow *significantly* misinterpreted each other.

I still think that I'm a ways off from getting up the nerve to ask her out on a date. And for all I know: things may very well not pan out.

The paradigm shift I've been gifted by this woman will still be there regardless though. I now have solid proof for myself that‚Äîeven in my sorry state‚Äîit's still possible for me to meet &amp; attract (desirable) women.

This whole experience has inspired a level of motivation in me that has never existed before now. I feel motivated to eat healthy, work out, learn new skills, etc.

I honestly can't remember the last time I've felt this happy. 

And now for my parting message: if something like this was able to happen to me, it could *definitely* happen to anyone else who considers themselves ForeverAlone (including you).

I've visited this subreddit occasionally in the past, and I can remember reading various success stories &amp; feeling completely disconnected from them. They seemed totally impossible for a guy like me to experience.

Miracles apparently *do* happen though, even to the least of us.  ;)

Ok. I guess that's all I wanted to get off my chest. Thanks to those of you (if any) who actually read this sappy diatribe.","I'm a 34 yr old virgin, and to my utter disbelief: an 8/10 hottie has recently started proactively flirting with me.",BubbaTheBlackJesuit

I‚Äôve tried dating apps for the past few years and had barely had any luck at all. A few weeks ago, I decided to redownload Bumble to try my luck and fail once again. 

I shockingly matched with a girl on there, and she messaged me fairly quickly. I was honestly shocked, but expected her to ghost me really after a little while. We somehow ended up keeping up a conversation, and have been texting over the past weeks. A little before Christmas, we even had a video call. I was really nervous and came across as kinda awkward(I literally said ‚Äúsorry I‚Äôm being awkward‚Äù) but she seemed to be ok with it. 

That leads to the beginning of this week. We were messaging and she mentioned she was doing a beer tasting at home. So we started talking about it, and mentioned us meeting up at a brewery downtown that I‚Äôve never been to. This place apparently has decent social distancing rules, so we decided to try it. I set the day and time. 

I should be happy now, but I‚Äôm kinda just nervous. I feel like I‚Äôm going to run out of things to say and things will get awkward. Logically I know things should be ok though.

ForeverAlone,"Now before I proceed I'd like to acknowledge that the advice itself isn't bad. Hell it can be pretty helpful in some fields, but when it comes to romantic relations I think it's criminally overrated.

Sure it CAN help you grow the balls to approach women or anyone of the opposite sex but I really don't think this helps as much as some people think it does. I know there may appear to be an echo chamber of how much looks gets emphasized on this sub but in reality there's a lot of truth to it. Everyone wants to be with someone they're physically attracted to and if you're not attractive physically no amount of confidence in the world will matter much. There's exceptions sure, but far and few. There's also the possibility that said unattractive people that found success have good financial status so that's probably a redeeming factor. 

I feel like ""confidence"" is just a scapegoat used to make people's standards in dating seem less superficial than they are, truth is it's not always as simple as someone getting rejected because they didn't believe in themselves. Same way it's not always as simple as someone getting rejected because of their looks alone, though it plays a big ass part in the dating game especially when you're young. I'll put it like this, and call this anecdotal evidence if you want, but I've seen FAR more attractive people with lack of confidence get into relationships than I've seen unattractive people with confidence get into one. That's just how it is in the world.

I'm not here to shit on confidence as advice overall, it's a very useful tool to help build character and make the best decisions for your life because you know what you want. Unfortunately it's not always the best advice in the context of the dating game specifically, as odd as that may sound. Confidence will get certain people far but for others it don't make a damn difference.",My take on the confidence argument,ODB95
ForeverAlone,"this is something i always fucking hear. ""you were bullied in school? you missed out in high school or college? don't worry, people like you become billionaires with supermodel and the people who have lots of friends and party become homeless and ugly"". that's BS.

According to data I've read, people who are bullied in school are more likely to end up in poverty and have depression or mental issues in adulthood. I also read that involuntarily celibate people (aka foreveraloners) were often socially withdrawn, bullied during their childhood, and rejected and ridiculed by their peers. Also I read that college bullying is very common (it's true. bullying doesn't after high school) and that college bullying victims were often bullied before college (and college bullies often were bullies before college). I [also read that school bullying victims are more likely to be victims of workplace bullying](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/10710503_Victimization_in_the_school_and_the_workplace_Are_there_any_links) (with bully-victims aka those who were both bullies and bullying victims having the highest risk but those who were only victims also had a higher risk than non-bullying victims).

Now as for the cool crowd in high school, many say they become hobos or balding and fat and poor later in life. no. not necessarily. there was one study that went on the news confirming that popular kids do become more likely to end up this way, but it had a relatively small sample size of only 183 kids from one very specific middle school in southeastern USA and it was a bunch of middle school kids who all lost popularity in high school (at age 15). and it revealed who they were at 22/23 but never mentioned where they ended up in their 30s. One study showed that those popular by likability (being kind to others and making friends) succeed in life while those who are popular by power (think of Mean Girls movie) are less successful. but some popular kids can be the former instead of the latter. Bullies do become more likely to become criminals or something later in life but not all popular kids are rude or are bullies, many can be friendly but it of course depends on the school.

but i've read studies showing completely different results. Studies show that [high school athletes get much better grades and are more likely to graduate and less likely to drop out](https://news.ku.edu/2014/01/15/study-shows-high-school-athletes-performed-better-school-persisted-graduation-more-non) and have [higher GPAs](https://www.nwmissouri.edu/library/ResearchPapers/2012/Stegall,%20Ryan.pdf). Studies also [show the more sports you play, the higher your GPA is and the less amount of days you are absent.](https://insideoutinitiative.org/2018/07/26/using-data-to-show-the-link-between-sports-participation-and-academic-achievement/) Studies also show that [cheerleaders have higher GPAs, better grades, volunteer more and participate in more activities and organizations](https://www.momsteam.com/sports/cheerleaders-are-leaders-on-and-off-sports-sidelines-survey-finds).

I've also read that the cool kids in college (ie: Greek life students) tend to get better grades and have successful job careers later in life (the ***only*** downside they have is being more likely to have alcohol problems).

now i know many people here are going to say ""but... but the cool people from my high school and now hobos and the outcasts became billionaires married to supermodels"". first of all, i won't be surprised if you're lying or at least exaggerating, and second of all, your high school doesn't represent other high schools. look up the anecdotal fallacy and hasty generalizations fallacy. your experience doesn't debunk statistics. i'm 23, the popular kids at my high school went to really good universities with sometimes low acceptance rates and just finished their bachelor's degree all in 4 years and have really successful jobs while the awkward, nerdy, sometimes autistic students all have barely finished community college.",the idea that the cool kids in high school/college become losers/hobos/etc and the outcasts become successful later on is a myth,IZ0LATION

They went back to take out only (Governor closed in person dining) And one night we had a particularly long conversation and she gave me her number.
We texted a bit and then she gave me a call and we talked for 4 hours and then an hour and a half the next day. Got to know a fair amount about one another and planned to go for a walk at a nearby park (not much else to do right now because of shutdowns, she seemed open to the idea). 
Last I heard from her was on the 23rd of December at first I believed I was assuming the worst and figured that perhaps due to her age she was more of a phone call than text person.I knew she was going to be spending the holidays with her family so I figured I'd give her some time and not bug her since we haven't really made that strong of a connection other than talking a few times. Sent her a Merry Christmas text as I do for almost everyone I know and tried giving a call on the 27th but didn't get an answer and haven't heard a peep.

ForeverAlone,"I was writing to myself last night, about the idea of actually being in a relationship of any sort -- not just as this far-away abstract thing I tell myself I want to work towards, but really trying to imagine it happening in my mind's eye. Imagining the girl being right there. Looking them in the eyes, asking questions, having conversations, doing activities, touch, kissing, sex, cuddling. All of these things with someone I don't *really* know yet. Far different than the imagined comfort and familiarity of a long-time partner. But that takes time, if it ever happens. Everyone starts out as a stranger.

Every aspect just seems incredibly overwhelming. What if I ended up freezing or crying? I felt anxious as I was writing, and when I was done, I had to go sleep for a few hours. I knew it was bad, but goddamn, I really *am* afraid of people. Feel like I need to be handled like a nervous puppy or something, by someone understanding. That doesn't sound like something that would happen.

To add to all of that, I'm always struggling with my sexuality, and I'm not sure if I'm even capable of loving someone. Do I actually want a relationship, or just the idea of one? Do I like people enough to want to make someone a core part of the rest of my life, or is that too much? How does one go into dating with these questions, which at the same time require some form of dating to resolve? And it just seems too fast, too linear, too serious. It seems like everything is casual or trying to be lifelong, and neither of those situations provides an environment where I can be both sexually and emotionally safe and figure myself out.

Though that desired safety is an illusion anyway. There's always risk, and you have to engage in a degree of risk to get anything out of life. But I don't know what it's going to take for me to feel comfortable with other people. Even a fellow weirdo. How I can get past this, when I'm so socially destitute that being face to face with another human being is highly unusual. I'm not interested in bars nor the meetup circuit. Before covid, during covid, after covid, things will be pretty much the same for me.

Evidently I am not ready for dating, but then what if I never am? I tell myself it's not good to rush, but it's also clear that the pool of compatibles shrinks with every year. And I'm trying to quit porn so that I can remove its influence from whatever my sexuality and libido really are, but this may be contributing to the anxiety I am also feeling again right now. I don't see how I'm supposed to pull this off for years and years, being where I am. Realistically, I will probably not meet anyone anytime within the next several years no matter what I do. I am probably also underestimating just how unready I am, and that even as it seems like the most counter-intuitive thing, I am probably better off giving no thought to any of this at all. I don't know anymore. I've wasted too much time trying to figure out what the best way to go about things is. I need to truly open myself up to the possibility that it doesn't matter.

I failed with women, both genetic and/or transgender and I had a few experiences which may be deemed gay. To summarize: prolonged loneliness (hence why I am posting here), conflicts over sexual attraction (although I don‚Äôt generally like men or masculine people when it comes to attraction). 

In this last year, I have to admit my interest for ‚Äúfemale parts‚Äù has disappeared and I only get aroused when thinking about c**ks. The last time, more than three years ago, I had one in my mouth I was told (it was someone who identifies as female, without being on hormones though) that I must always have liked it, I only refused to accept it. 

I am not sure I wanna sleep with a man in the future but I cannot rule it out. I guess my experience is the result of several factors being combined, as described above.

However, what do you think in this respect? May being lonely turn into a so powerful factor to affect sexual orientation?",Going gay to cope with loneliness? Not possible I believe but what is your view?,stefy84
ForeverAlone,"I mean lest be honest, she could do do much better than me, why would she bother sticking with me when she could easily find someone else who is more attractive, makes more money, has a more interesting life, ect

I hate being alone, but, it's what I'm used to, been alone for the past 19 years, and I'm expecting to be alone for the next 50-60 if I live that long

And lest be honest, even if by some miracle I got a gf or even get married, like I said, she would be able to 1000 times better than me, I wouldn't be surprised if I got cheated on, or just randomly ghosted or randomly broken up with ect, and the thing is I wouldnt blame her

 I mean I think I'm a nice guy, but I don't really have anything else to offer, my looks are average at best, I'm not smart, strong, funny, I'm not poor, but I'm not making enought money to be impressing women 

So to summarize how I think my life will be in the future:

Work 9-5 for 5 days a week for the next 40-50 years, stay alone and miserable till I die in my 60s-70s

ForeverAlone,"If you go on subs like r/AmITheAsshole people call you the asshole if you refuse to date a promiscuous woman (I don‚Äôt mind promiscuous women btw). But if a woman says on there she refused to date a virgin man, people on there will tell her she isn‚Äôt the asshole unless she acted downright rude about it.

People literally will kill you if you condemn promiscuity but if you mock virgins they don‚Äôt mind. If you reject someone because they‚Äôre a virgin, society doesn‚Äôt mind, but reject a promiscuous person and society will go insane.

If you condemn those who reject promiscuous people but then reject virgins, you‚Äôre a hypocrite.

It‚Äôs simple: a potential partner‚Äôs sexual history shouldn‚Äôt matter to me, and it doesn‚Äôt matter to me for that matter. But 51% of women said they won‚Äôt date a virgin compared to 33% of men. I have also read studies that young adults are less willing to date a virgin than older adults and that virgins are less likely than non-virgins to date a virgin (although another study shows that virgins are more likely than non-virgins to give a virgin a chance).

They always say ‚Äúbut virgins are clingy or don‚Äôt know what they‚Äôre doing‚Äù or ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt wanna teach them‚Äù (impatient) or ‚Äúthey won‚Äôt have any experience‚Äù. First of all, not all virgins are clingy and that stereotype is bs. Second, not all experienced people are good either. Some experienced people won‚Äôt care about what their partner wants. And also, they say ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to be their first‚Äù which is total insecurity or ‚ÄúI worry if I leave them it‚Äôll damage them emotionally‚Äù. I think rejecting them for being a virgin will do far more emotional damage.

You can‚Äôt say it‚Äôs ok to reject virgins and then condemn those who reject promiscuous people. Either both are ok or both are unacceptable. And I don‚Äôt wanna hear ‚Äúbut I don‚Äôt wanna teach them‚Äù or ‚Äúthey don‚Äôt know what they‚Äôre doing‚Äù because if they cooperate in bed they can a little later become good at it. Not every sexually active person is good in bed anyway.",People who get mad at someone for refusing to date promiscuous people but then refuse to date a virgin are hypocrites,IZ0LATION
ForeverAlone,"Here's a big characteristic among involuntary virgin adults (adults who are virgins despite wanting to find a relationship): many were bullied, victimized, or ridiculed by their peers in their childhood and were socially withdrawn (preferred to play alone). If there's a kid in elementary school you remembered who played alone and was bullied and rejected by his peers, he might be still a virgin as an adult.

Men who start puberty late and who are physically immature in their teenage years also are more likely to remain virgins as adults. This isn't surprising. Physical maturity is crucial for a man to be conventionally attractive. For example, if a 17 year old guy looks like a genuine 24 year old guy, many girls at school will like him.

I've also read that race plays a role too. Asian men are more likely to remain virgins in adulthood and the same is true for Indian men. Asian women, on the other hand, not so much. Indian women also lack some sexual success to an extent but not to the extent of Indian men. I've read studies that among the minority of college students who never had a first kiss, many of them were Asian men, and that Asian college men and Indian college men are significantly less sexually successful than college men of other races (white, black, latino). I also read that Asian teenage boys and Asian young adult men are more likely to be single or virgins than their white, black, latino, etc. male counterparts. (I think the same might be true for Asian women at least to an extent).

Men who are physically unattractive also are more likely to remain virgins in adulthood, and people who tend to be shy or have social anxiety also are more likely to be virgins in adulthood. In a study of an admittedly small sample size (but still one of the earlier and very pivotal studies on involuntary sexual inexperience) in 2001, most participants believed being shy or socially anxious was why they couldn't find anyone. Half of them had a poor body image and blamed their physical appearance. 91% of virgins said they never dated as teenagers and 52% of singles (those who had sexual experience in the past whether it's with a hooker/sexual surrogate or a genuine partner but are now involuntarily celibate) said they never dated as teenagers.

Being overweight or having a high BMI also is a risk factor for adulthood virginity and so is being religious or having strict parents that disapprove of sex or dating. Autism also significantly increases the risk of involuntary celibacy during adulthood. In a study with an admittedly small sample size (but noteworthy results that should be replicated in future studies), 44.6% of men with autism said they never have sex, despite the vast majority strongly desiring it. Half of autistic women never had sex, but many autistic women didn't even desire sex. Only a tiny minority of autistic men were in a relationship whereas, ironically (given what was previously mentioned), it was quite common for autistic women to be in a relationship. Autistic men also masturbated far more often than most men, were far more hypersexual, and were significantly more likely to engage in paraphilic or atypical sexual fantasies or behaviors such as voyeurism, sadism, and even pedophilia. It also revealed autistic people were much more likely to be LGBT and were far more accepting of LGBT people (it's unknown if this finding controlled for LGBT autistic people and if they confirmed cishet autistic people were more accepting for LGBT people than neurotypical people).

[I‚Äôm](https://imgur.com/a/3s0gQEJ) a 22 year old autistic male who has depression and anxiety and might be bipolar too. Because of these things, I‚Äôve always had difficulties socializing and finding a partner especially. Out in public, I tried just walking up to women and talking to them or just waving and I either get looked at weird or cussed out or some variation of that. Because of all the bad experiences I‚Äôve had trying to go out and meet women, I use dating apps (I use all the popular ones) and that doesn‚Äôt work either no matter what advice I follow or who looks at my profile. 

The closest I‚Äôve come to having a partner was some woman on InterPals who lived in Europe last summer. Surprise surprise, she ghosted me for another man even after telling me she loved and cared about me. I am still in a lot of pain over what happened because I genuinely saw a future with her...

I don‚Äôt have looks (I‚Äôm not obese or overweight even, but I‚Äôm no movie star), personality, or money on my side and probably never will because of my condition(s). I have very boring homebody hobbies like reading books and gaming too. On top of this, I have a hard time relating to people my age (both male and female). Making friends and finding romantic partners has always been difficult for me. Even now, most of my friends are online or they lived near me but moved away and I don‚Äôt get to see them.

ForeverAlone,"
TLDR: girl was apparently so attracted to me that we discussed starting a long distance relationship and had sexual conversations. Then she ghosted me, apparently because of personal issues and not being willing to socialise, before I found a comment on her reddit profile asking someone to DM her. 

I am a early to mid twenties male.

About a month ago, I made a post on r/virginityexchange and r/r4r where I talked about my lack of romantic or sexual success. I posted pictures of myself asked if anyone was willing to have sex with me. 

A woman in her mid twenties messaged me and said that she found me very attractive. We started talking and it turned out we had many things in common and found it easy to converse. 

We talked everyday for a couple of weeks, through a social app where we would message and call each other. 

A couple of days into talking, she started telling me about her ADHD, bipolar disorder, suicidal depression, and a sexually abusive relationship she suffered from. She had extensive therapy and medication. 

She also made her romantic interest in me very obvious, or so I thought. She insisted that I was very attractive on a physical and intellectual level (I‚Äôm not an intellectual person, but I have a particular passion which made her see me in that way. Unless it was part of an act) as well as in terms of our compatibility. She said that she was surprised that I wasn‚Äôt bringing a new girl back every night (which is a ridiculous statement considering I‚Äôm short, skinny, and generally very meek looking). 

We live in different countries, but we often mentioned that we wanted to meet to see if a relationship could work out. 

We also talked in detail about sex, our experiences (or the lack) and what we would like to do with each other if we ever met. She mentioned that she had a high libido, yet had not had sex with anyone in a few years.

She also sent me naked pictures of herself. She suggested the idea first. I wasn‚Äôt going to refuse them, obviously. 

About a week into talking with her, I browsed the comments of her reddit profile. I came across a comment she made where she mentioned she had a boyfriend. It was from a couple weeks before we started talking.

I confronted her about this, and suggested that it was her ex. She said yes, and I apologised. She did not seem bothered at all. 

Soon after this, she stops replying to my messages. 

After a couple of days, I sent her a message on a different app we had used, and she said she wanted to avoid socialising as she wasn‚Äôt feeling well. She apologised for not making that clear. I said that was no problem, and said I would like to speak again when she was ready.

She did not reply to this and again there was a communication cut off for a few days. She messaged me again, apologising for disappearing. I thought this meant that she wanted to talk again, but we just went into another cut off.

About a week later, I see that she has changed her profile picture to one where she is with a man. A generic selfie. He has a protective mask on, indicating that the picture was taken within this year. 

She also blocked me. As I‚Äôm a very insecure person, I started formulating theories that she had a boyfriend all along and was using me, or that she thought she was doing me a kindness by pretending that I was extremely attractive for a couple of weeks. 

Fortunately, she had not blocked me on another social app. I sent her this message:

‚ÄúHi [name of girl I‚Äôve been speaking to], I‚Äôve seen that you blocked me on [social app]. As you know I really struggle with dating, finding people who are attracted to me and maintaining interest. Making a connection in other words.

If there‚Äôs some specific reason why you‚Äôre choosing not to speak to me, I would really like to hear it. Even if it‚Äôs something that I can‚Äôt change, such as some aspect of my physical appearance. But if you could actually give me some advice, I would really appreciate it. 

After that, I promise that I will never try speaking with you again.‚Äù

She replied quickly. She told me about how a couple of people she was close to had died, and that she didn‚Äôt want to bring negativity to the people she socialised with.

She said her feelings towards me had not changed, but that she hoped I would have forgotten or stopped caring about her because we hadn‚Äôt talked for a while (which was, to be honest, a stupid assumption to make considering that I have no romantic prospects). 

This was apparently because she was worried that I would be upset about her putting me on the ‚Äúback burner‚Äù. 

I replied:

‚ÄúI‚Äôm really sorry to hear that. I can‚Äôt imagine how that feels. And I‚Äôm really sorry for making assumptions. And I can assure you that I really would care if you stopped talking to me, but if that‚Äôs how it has to be for an indefinite amount of time then that‚Äôs fine, I‚Äôll deal with it. Your problems are much worse and you need space. I‚Äôm sorry for accusing you, I won‚Äôt message you again.

In situations like this I think it‚Äôs reasonable if you don‚Äôt want to talk for a long time. It‚Äôs a shame that I had to push you to reply to me, my issue is that I really want to know why people don‚Äôt talk to me, but perhaps I should let things go because I can understand if you didn‚Äôt want to reveal these tragic events in your life.

Take as much time as you need to heal. If you feel ready and you want to talk again, please let me know. If you never message me, then I know that I should move on.‚Äù

She thanked me and that was the end of the conversation.

Looking back, she really emphasised that she expected me to lose interest and to not feel bad if I did. 

I get obsessed with women who show ambiguous interest in me (these obsessions are rare because it is extremely unusual for a woman to do something that I would interpret as romantic interest. However, if they provide closure on their real feelings, then I lose interest as well). I‚Äôve been checking her reddit everyday.

Today, she made a comment where she asked someone to message her. Just for a friendly conversation about an interest she shared with the other user.

So it would appear she‚Äôs ready to socialise. But not with me apparently.

ForeverAlone,"This is going to be a little long. I just want to paint a full picture of the situation.

I'm a 22 year old guy who's recently realized that I'm not as completely straight as I thought I was my entire life. I've been talking to this guy on tinder for a few weeks. I'll call him JV. He's basically the perfect guy. He's very attractive and talented. He's a former model, he can sing and play a lot of instruments. He's the same age as me. He's told me that he's obsessed with me and falling for me, how he can see himself spending his life with me, and how the reason other dates I went on didn't lead to another one was because no one else is as smart as me, and that he's probably my perfect match. I'm basically social inept, never been in any relationships and only been on a few dates, but this seemed like everything I was longing for. A really attractive guy really likes me. I couldn't believe it.

I told him about bad experiences I've had with people on dating apps before and he said that I must attract crazy people, but now I have him, and he'll sing me to sleep at night. I'm socially awkward so I've never been in a relationship before, and have only been on 3 dates so far, but this seems like something that I've been longing for for a while. The only potential issue is that we live an hour away from each other and I can't drive yet (I've taken driving lessons on and off over the years but I just have difficulty with it.)

We started messaging each other on snapchat and he started talking about how he wants to do dirty things to me. I told him that I don't like to talk sexually with someone when I don't know them that well, we've only been talking for a few days at most at that point. He told me that I made it seem like I didn't want to have sex with him. I told him that I did, but I like to take things slow, and he understood.

We videochatted a few days before we planned to go on a date. During the call, he told me that he was ""complicated"". He told me that he cheated on his previous boyfriend with older men because he has ""daddy issues"" and his ex boyfriend didn't satisfy his sexual needs, that one of his flaws is that he likes sex too much and that he blew JV off and didn't spend time with him a lot. This made me a little nervous, especially because me and him live an hour away from each other and JV and his ex boyfriend did too. But when I brought up my concerns to him the next day, he assured me that he regretted cheating in his previous relationship.

We set up a date on a Saturday, to go to a diner near me for lunch. We were texting the night before and I mentioned a first date I went on last year where the guy tried to have sex with me, and how it made me feel because I don't like to have sex on the first date. JV replied saying that maybe we should cancel the date and go our separate ways because we're too different of people.

¬†I told him that was probably for the best, as I didn't know where we could have sex because my family lives with my stepdad and he doesn't like me, my sister or any of his kids having significant others spend the night at the house. JV said that his ex stayed over at his house when they were dating, and that his family was fine with it, so I could too. He asked if I'd be able to fulfill his sexual needs and I told him that I could change my sexual boundaries for him, and he said that he thinks that this relationship could work.

We went on the date and it went well. He told me that he usually doesn't drive an hour to meet someone for the first time, and that he didn't think he'd be trying to get into a relationship so soon after his last one ended, but that there was something about me that changed his mind on those things.  We had lunch and then we made out for a bit. It was my first kiss. He asked if I wanted to go further, and I said that I didn't. After the date, we kept texting and we planned a second date. He said that he wanted to have sex with me on the second date and that if it was good, I'd be his boyfriend. We started talking about what kind of stuff we'd do to each other and sending each other nudes. He asked if I'd take him to my room to have sex, and I reminded him that I couldn't do that.

He said that it had to be in his car then, which I thought was kind of strange, since the reason we were even still talking to each other was because he assured me that we could have sex at his house. His family was moving soon, but he knew about that before the night before the first date, so it wasn't like it unexpectedly came up after. I asked him if we would wear condoms, and he said that if we were dating, that we'd only be having sex with each other, so we wouldn't have to, and also that he wanted to cum inside me.

I realized that even though I found him very attractive and he kind of drove me crazy, I didn't want to have sex on the second date. It's just too soon for me. I feel like I don't really know someone that well after talking for a few weeks and going on one date. I told him that I didn't feel like we were sexually compatible and that we should probably stop talking. He got upset, saying that I was acting like he was a sex addict and that he was hurt that I would assume that about him. I told him that I changed my mind but he said that I already made my choice, and that he couldn't be with someone who didn't know if they wanted to be with him.

We've stopped talking now, and I'm extremely frustrated with myself. This guy was so sweet to me. He was my perfect match and I completely ruined what would have been a great relationship.

ForeverAlone,"Hello again, thought I'd just give an update on my previous [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAlone/comments/k3x6me/the_impossible_has_happened/) from last week. She and I had made plans to go out to eat at a restaurant on Friday 12/4, but since covid cases had been getting really high where we are in Massachusetts, we decided that indoor dining just really wasn't a good idea. Instead, she suggested we get takeout from the restaurant and eat it at a firepit out back behind her apartment. I think we made the right call, and it made for a better night anyway. I learned that I apparently don't know how to make a fire, since it kept dying out, but it was still a nice night and we ended up cuddling and kissing. We've also been video chatting just about every day and I'm gonna see her again tomorrow night. 

She's said that wants to take things slowly and not rush into a relationship or put labels on things, which I have no problem with since I've obviously never done this before. Despite her saying that though, I'm not sure what you call it when you video chat with and send good morning texts to someone every day, and make plans to hang out frequently. She also said she's not gonna be looking for other guys on the dating apps, and at one point apropos of nothing, she said she wants to celebrate my birthday with me, which she knows isn't until June. So while I guess we're technically not in a relationship at the moment, it seems kinda inevitable.

The only thing is though, it seems like her family doesn't really approve of her seeing me. I guess it's not me personally, she says part of it is because they don't know me, (why would they?) and I guess she just got out of a relationship a few months ago, and they don't think she should be jumping into another. That's part of why she wants to take things slowly too, the other part is she knows I've never been in a relationship before, which she has no problem with, and doesn't want to make me feel uncomfortable. 

I guess I'm not technically in a relationship with her at the moment, but I mean I basically am, and I'm sure we'll make it official at some point down the line. I guess I won't be posting much around here for now, but we'll see how it goes, I may be back at some point. 

But yeah, just thought I'd keep you all abreast of my situation. For the rest of you good luck, I was feeling pretty discouraged before I met this girl, and it basically came out of nowhere, so you never know, there may be hope yet.",The Impossible Has Happened Update,thekraken108

ForeverAlone,"You only hear about the success stories, because people who are successful broadcast it all over social media, and are eager to share their accomplishments with others. 

The ones who fade into the background deleted their social medias a long time ago, because they have nothing to brag about. 

You can pretend that everyone‚Äôs life works out eventually, or that everyone‚Äôs life is a series of peaks and valleys that are filled with occasional highlights and also moments of sadness.

But for some people, it‚Äôs all downhill from the moment they‚Äôre born. And it‚Äôs not even necessarily that person‚Äôs fault; they may have just been born into an environment that wasn‚Äôt conducive to their success.

Either way, I‚Äôm sick of people pretending that unsuccessful people don‚Äôt exist, or that everyone eventually finds happiness in some form. Let‚Äôs finally admit that it is possible for someone to be born, and have a shitty fucking life for however many years they live on this planet. 

I don‚Äôt care if they were born in America, Brazil, Tokyo, or Canada, it‚Äôs always possible for people to slip through the cracks and live a life that isn‚Äôt noteworthy in any conceivable way, or to experience mostly negative human emotions for the duration of their existence. 

You‚Äôre not doing anyone any favors by feeding them false optimism, or assuming that their live is going to get better ‚Äúeventually‚Äù. Maybe for some, but not everyone has a reason to hope for something better. 

At a certain point, you can assess the type of life you‚Äôre going to have based on your previous actions, and your actions now. 

Have you been successful or happy in the past? No? Do you have reason to believe based on your current trajectory that happiness or success is coming around the corner anytime soon? No? There‚Äôs your answer then.

Nobody will be straight-up with you and say it, because it‚Äôs sad to think about.

ForeverAlone,"I (M19) have been lonely my entire life and never had any friends up until high school who were borderline abusive and were toxic to me every day for about two and a half years. Then when I started college, I made friends with my roommate and his friend but after the first semester his friend dropped out and we weren‚Äôt really close after that. Then when covid and everything happened, I had no one apart from a few online friends.

ForeverAlone,"I never had dozens of friends, nowhere close to that. But in kindergarten, I still remember approaching some kids on the playground who immediately invited me to play along. Those kids went on to be my real friends in primary school. There were about 5-6 of us. I was the ugly fat kid, but at least other kids wanted to hang out with me. We went to each other's houses to play video games, have fun.

But then we went to 7th grade, which is where high school starts where I live. Now, there are like 5 high schools in my city, and of those 5 friends, 2 went to the same one as me. I just lost complete contact with the 3 others. I don't blame them or myself at all, it's just a damn shame. Of the remaining 2, one moved to the other side of the planet a few months later. One friend left, but luckily the both of us quickly made 2 new friends. This lasted some years, but in 11th grade, they both started completely ignoring me and my other friend. That's when shit *really* got real. Because it was obvious those two encouraged others to hate and ignore us too. But while it may seem like that, I wouldn't call it bullying.  I guess we were just the two quiet weird guys. Still, imagine that, a guy who was your friend 2 years before mocks you at high school graduation basically in front of all other students and parents.

I'm 5 years into university now. At best, I've made a lot of *acquaintances*. Nobody I text often, if anyone sends me anything it's school related or it's a meme in a long dead meme chat group.

So here's the thing. The whole and entire my adult life was filled with tons of attempts of looking for a partner (woman), because it feels like whenever im with company, i feel so secure and happier and so productive. Went through several serious relationships but failed, until last November, again the relationship failed because of religion differences (she refused to just get along with the differences). finally, i proposed to another woman, she's my ex and the longest relationship in my life. Our family are supportive with the idea, but she said that she wanna pray about it first and until now i havent heard anything from her.

The thing is, i feel like im really done with casual dating (probably more than 30 dates the whole my life), i was what people called playboy or other bullshit back then in highschool. but since college, i never do such shit again and that was 2012, almost like 9 nine years. it's not that im not a functional adult, i have a really good paid job (by Indonesian standard), have hobbies and passion that basically are rising to fame eventhough it's slow as fuck.

I just wanna start my own family, all of my friends are having their family rn, please dont tell me to not comparing my life with others because ive been trying to play cool with that shit since 2017 and eventually people started to disappeared one by one because of their relationships and leaving me behind with such narrow circle of friends. and im kinda really sick of just working and do shit and come home just to suck the loneliness into sleep// the biggest factor that im so afraid of is i really need to just communicate with human being and do activities with them and since i cant do that on a daily basis with friends (they have their own shit, duh) one solution is to find a goddamn life partner, which, i cant find rn. tried dating apps and shit and thats just led me into pointless sex life and im giving up on that lately.

thats where i finally started to think about ending myself, because if im going to have this world but have no one beside me to share the shit with me, what's the point? and that feeling is growing stronger and stronger everyday leaving me crying every night and now taking dramamine for sleep like everyday since last month. its fucking terrible.

They‚Äôll sugar coat it and try to reassure me that I‚Äôm not that ugly, but they‚Äôre still too honest to ever directly say I‚Äôm attractive in any way. Sometimes their attempts even work, and it gets to the point where I can work up some form of confidence in my appearance. After I achieve that newfound confidence I decide to try putting myself out there again.

For context I‚Äôm mtf who suffers from cPTSD and because of that I have no trust in people what so ever. The reasons I don‚Äôt trust people are far too long for what‚Äôll probably be long, because I don‚Äôt trust people I‚Äôve sworn off romantic and sexual relationships and being mtf makes it harder to date in general. 
For the past few sessions my doctor has been telling me that I should get on a dating app (grinder, tinder or any of the others, honestly I don‚Äôt even know the names) and start talking to people. The problem is I‚Äôve tried dating apps before (before I transitioned) and it‚Äôs never been good. Everyone I talked to only wanted to hookup (something I‚Äôll never do) or where the most boring/toxic people ever. 
Anyways, because my Dr. keeps telling me to get on an app my mind had been in flux on what I should do. I know I‚Äôm not asexual because I feel both attractions but I still don‚Äôt want to date, probably ever. If my doctor says I should one more time I will take my belt off in her office and threaten suicide. She‚Äôs supposed to help me through my mind but every time she brings up me dating I feel so empty, dead and I feel worse every time she brings it up.

ForeverAlone,"Some of you may or may not remember my previous posts about online dating where I was evidently led on by one girl, and then ghosted by another. Naturally, I was still having no luck for the next few months but decided I had nothing to lose to keep trying, so I did. Well come Saturday, November 21st, I matched with another girl on the Facebook Dating app. I reached out to her, we talked a bit, and by Sunday we had already moved the conversation to Snapchat. By Monday, she wanted to video chat which we did, and then we ended up video chatting a lot over the next few days. 

At this point, it was apparent that she likes me and even seemed to be more into me than I am her. Which isn't to say that I don't like her, she just seems to like me more so, she's the one who suggested video chatting, and my plan was to ask her on the Wednesday before Thanksgiving if she'd wanna meet over this past weekend, but she beat me to it. We set up a plan to meet Saturday, and still did a lot of video chatting between Wednesday and then. At some point, we had exchanged actual phone numbers too. 

So we met in person on Saturday, didn't really do a whole lot, she needed me to pick her up from a friend's place in the late afternoon/early evening, and then we ended up taking a walk at some park near where she lives and then just hung out and talked on a park bench for a couple of hours. We didn't kiss, but we did hold hands and cuddle a bit, under the guise of needing to warm up with body heat since it was cold out of course. After I took her home, we talked about getting together again this coming Friday, and maybe even doing something indoors this time, although we'll see how that goes with covid and all. 

She briefly called me later on Saturday night, and then we talked on and off throughout the day yesterday too. So I think it's safe to say things are good with her for now. We'll see how it goes, but hey, I finally went out with a girl. It probably should have happened about 7-10 years earlier, but better late than never I suppose.

\-I ask her out and she says she's had contact with someone COVID positive along with her friend and she can't.

\-Without me even asking, she texts me that she hanged out with her other friend who's had COVID contact, and that she wanted me to know that she didn't just say it because she didn't want to hang out with me or anything.

Four years ago I started university and had so much hope for everything. I made new friends very quickly, but as the months and years passed, they realized what a boring person I am and started hanging out with others. Now I'm 6 months away from graduating meaning I'll leave university as there's no way on earth I can do/try a PhD since my grades have been meh as fuck through the years. What's left after that?

I can't remember the last time someone texted me when it wasn't about school work. Nobody will ever introduce me to new people.

ForeverAlone,"i feel this is the only subreddit where i can openly talk about this without being gaslighted or ridiculed. people always keep saying that popularity doesn't exist in college and that nobody cares about it in college. well that's a bullshit myth. it exists just as much in college. i don't wanna hear ""but you won't know the names of the popular kids"", because if you go to a 4 year uni, you'll probably know at least a couple of people who are in greek life or who party every weekend. and you won't always know the names of EVERY popular kid in high school. also, if high school was 30,000 people on a big campus of several buildings, we also would know the names of less popular kids in high school and if college was 2000 people in one small building we'd know more of their names easily.

when i was in college, i went to a community college where nobody spoke to each other and we all just went to class and walked back home. i couldn't make any friends, i never got to meet anyone. i am a kissless virgin who was isolated and lonely throughout college. and as a i rotted in loneliness, there were fraternity guys who partied every weekend, had an attractive girlfriend and lots of friends. and people actually think i am just as popular as the fraternity guy? seriously? Greek life is PROOF that popularity exists in college and college parties also are proof it exists. how the hell is a friendless virgin in isolation just as popular as a good-looking frat boy who parties each weekend and has many friends?

and don't call me ""weird"" for caring about popularity. go ahead and say ""it doesn't matter"", but when i'm a guy who was isolated and didn't have anyone to talk to, of course i'll envy a guy who parties often and has lots of friends, and i don't need to be ridiculed for wanting to experience that type of lifestyle. and i am NOT the only college guy who cares about this. if you think college kids don't care about popularity, you're wrong. In one survey, nearly half of college kids reported experiencing FOMO (fear of missing out) and in another survey, 75% of young adults age 18 to 22 reported having FOMO. If you ask them if they care about popularity they probably will say ""no"" but ask these same people if they experience FOMO because they don't party or socialize a lot and many will say ""yes"". well that counts as caring about popularity. i don't need someone ridiculing me for experiencing severe FOMO, because it's common and justified, too. FOMO and wanting to socialize and party more is most widespread among college kids according to studies i've read.

sure, maybe community college doesn't have popularity but 4 year universities DO. and greek life and college parties are PROOF. and yeah you can say ""but college movies don't resemble college"", but guess what? those parties you see in movies do sometimes happen in college. people DO sometimes party and socialize and they often DO have sex in college. In fact, a good amount of college kids have said in surveys that they go to college just to party.

and as for bullying, bullying does NOT end after high school. in some college program, there was a girl who used to tease me and another girl who she was friends with who also teased and hassled me. and i'm NOT the only one. i read that 15-25% of college students report being bullied in college (real life offline bullying) and 1%-22% report being cyberbullied. and in one survey 42% of college students said they've witnessed a student get bullied and 60% in another survey reported seeing another student get bullied. bullying happens after college too. workplace bullying is very common. and i also read that college bullying victims often never tell anyone about it because they're taught to be independent and on their own and taught to handle their own issues. and sometimes their bully is their roommate. and much worse shit happens in college, too like hazing (which happens to college athletes not just frat boys) and campus rape/sexual assault (which doesn't just happen to sorority girls but also non-sorority girls). also, i read that many college bullying victims were bullied before college, too. and many bullies before college continue to be bullies during college. it doesn't ""get better"" in college. that's a BS myth.

TL;DR: when people tell me bullying and popularity end in college, i take it personally because i experienced severe FOMO and isolation in college and was hassled in college, and i feel like they're denying the existence of my problems and acting like my problems don't matter. they're gaslighting me. college parties, drinking, and greek life are proof popularity exists in college. and i'm already scared to post this out of fear of being gaslighted or called a ""freak"" for caring about this.

ForeverAlone,"So I‚Äôve never had a girlfriend in my entire life. Nor have I ever been kissed. I do not hate women. I do not blame them for this. I blame myself, and take full responsibility for my unworthiness.

Is that the definition of an incel? It‚Äôs a term that‚Äôs used in such a negative way that people automatically assume if you don‚Äôt have a girlfriend, then clearly you have some demented mental state or pure hatred for the opposite gender. I‚Äôve never thought about killing someone because they won‚Äôt have sex with me. I don‚Äôt even expect sex at all from most women that I meet. I don‚Äôt demand it from them.

But oh, I‚Äôm still single, and I‚Äôm a man, so therefore, I am an incel.

It makes no sense to me. Can‚Äôt we just say ""Oh, he's single"" and leave it at that? Why does it always turn into ""Oh, he‚Äôs an incel""?

ForeverAlone,"It doesn't matter that you have a university degree. Or that you're an intelligent person, speak 4 languages or play 2 musical instruments. That matters for attractive people. Actually it doesn't even matter for the super-attractive guys, some are dumb as a rock and still get plenty of women.

But if you're truly ugly, none of it matters in the slightest. You'll only ever be a girl's friend, whom she keeps at a distance,  but usually not even that.

For me, it's not even about being single, just having a normal life is difficult for a guy like me. Whenever I go out, girls cross the street when they see me or turn into a side alley. I've also noticed the problem is not limited to women my age, but women in general with the closer to her being my age, the higher the probability that she will actively try to avoid me. It's almost like she's saying ""I know you're desperate, because your ugliness says it all, and you're going to try to talk to me. Well, just so you  know, don't even *think* you have a chance with me."" With girls in my potential dating pool, i.e. age 20-30, I'd say it happens around 75% of the time. And people say looks don't matter. Give me a f*cking break.

Sometimes if I spend an hour or more to get ready in the morning, I'm treated more like an average guy, but even then only on a good day, plus I have to put in so much work just to get the same treatment that most people take for granted. Again, so much work just to  e average.

Any ugly experience you can think of, I've been there and done that. Not being approached by customer service in a store when everyone else is, arriving to a job interview only to see the disappointment and awkwardness in the manager's face the moment you walm through the door. Being underestimated and always seen as an underdog, for seemingly no concrete reason.

It's almost like if you're ugly, you don't get to fully participate in society. A normal life is taken away from you. And if you ever complain, you're seen as entitled. Entitled because you want to have a normal life like everybody else where you aren't reminded on a daily or almost-daily basis, that in the end, even if you have a few friends and a job, etc., you're still an outcast. It's like a concrete truth, set in stone, just like 2 + 2 equalling 4.

Plus, nobody seems to care if you complain, because hey you're ugly. In centuries past, when religion was more prominent you may have got some mercy, but in today's heartless and secular world, many people probably look at you and see you as evolutionarily inferior, a genetic dead end, a mistake, and so for then it's better if you die alone and childless, because otherwise you represent a step backwards for the human species

ForeverAlone,"I have reason to believe from over a considerable time period and and my luck with the simple continued interactions with the opposite sex (as a man), that I'm just plain ugly objectively. And it's a very hard life settling with the idea that sometimes ""being the bare minimum"" that a lot of women ask for (I don't think this would apply to women in the reverse case, but trying to make a point of a feeling), makes you only tolerable. I'm not being on my best behavior (because first of all this is who I am) just so I can land dates or proposals, it's just that there's that lack of interest in you in general as a person IRL, and you can almost feel it trickle down your spine, the feeling of being unwelcomed. The fact that people will engage with you only for something necessary in a friendly manner and nothing more. This feeling affects your psyche as well because now you are an expert at easily detecting and determining when you're unwanted but completely dense to the people that show a little bit of interest in you, but obviously they won't have ""time"" or ""empathy"" for your insecurities. 

I think in the physical plane this will always be my struggle. Making a good first physical impression is not my strength and I can't change what the divine 3D rendering tools have decided for me. I do have decent male and platonic female interactions, and now a romantic connection with someone and I can attribute (after completing 30 uninterrupted cycles around the Earth)  to do a lot with an unwavering set of good values and conduct. Never ever compromise them. There are people out there that can see the beauty in you but those will come with its own set of challenges completely alien to FA, that you will never encounter before.

First of all, obviously I wish to be in a healthy relationship, not in an abusive one. Yes, relationships are work and demand compromise. But your partner shouldn‚Äôt hold you back from doing things you love and cherish. 

So then people like to bring up how free and unrestrained single life is. And it might be, which probably is fun for most people during a certain time. But at some point in our lives, most of us want to start building a foundation for the future that is more secure. Not having a life partner takes away a lot of that. Even before that, it‚Äôs very limiting in many ways to not be in a relationship. Many forms of events or entertainment are geared towards couples or at the very least friend groups.

Next day she left and I was told that the house got sold 4 weeks to move out was a little stressed.

I‚Äôll try make this brief. Talking to this guy, lots of history and we started talking again and boy did we just fall right back into it, texting every second of the day we had time to and sarcastic flirting ALL the time, flirty and sexual comments but sex was never a must in the conversation. We could talk about anything for hours until all hours of the morning even if he‚Äôd work the next day, he didn‚Äôt care. Then we meet for the first time in nine months (he invited me to his best friends birthday) we talked a bit, got comfortable and when we were all chatting he was standing behind me and put his arms around my shoulders/chest area and just pulled me into him. He then went to town with his friend to get something and as he was leaving he ran back to me and asked me to kiss him, I kissed him on the cheek and after he said no on the lips and we kissed. When he came back I spent most of the night cuddled with him on his lap, him saying he loved me and missed me so much and at one point asking if I still liked him (he was very drunk at this point so I kind of ignored the question). The next day he was the same, super flirty and sweet and affectionate, then he slowly just started distancing himself all in one day.  We were talking about the night and he randomly interrupted me to ask what I wanted from talking to him. When I said I didn‚Äôt know he went SO FAR THE OPPOSITE WAY, man I got whiplash. He went full on oh yeh it‚Äôs good to be friends or whatever. He still drops the odd flirty text but there‚Äôs no actual substance behind it like before. I am so confused.

I also have  depression and anxiety but  have  started  a new mediation for those. I am lazy, unmotivated  and often  selfish. I have been complimented on my intelligence and many men -- online, at least --  often tell me I am beautiful,  sexy, gorgeous, et cetera, but I get that many of them are just  saying  that to get some action, though I hope  at least some are genuine.

I am introverted  too, something society does not like. I feel like a complete loser and that something is inherently wrong with me  and  it makes that...permanent ""solution"" more tempting sometimes. 

I feel stuck and don't know what to do to change it  and that I am pathetic and no one really wants me but someone will, at best, settle for me as a back burner option.

This is killing my spirit. I am so embarrassed and feel like this  world just isn't made for people like me and wonder if I am meant to be here.

If I didn't fear death, it would not devastate my family and I would not botch the attempt  and, thus, be a vegetable or  horribly disfigured but still self-aware, I'd probably have ended my life by now.

ForeverAlone,"Of course this will not work for everyone, but if it does great. Some of it may be common sense, but just putting it here as it could be helpful to others - will vary from person to person. This can be summarized into two main points:

&amp;#x200B;

**1 Cut out things that remind you of your loneliness.**

Maybe this is kind of a derivative of ""just be happy being single bro""

Social media - Instagram, facebook, tiktok, etc.. delete that shit

Avoid going to places were you are likely to see couples in a concentrated form: 

Restaurants on holidays especially valentines day, company parties/weddings/events where you can bring a +1 and you estimate 70%+ will bring a SO, ""romantic areas"", living situation with roommates that go on lots of dates or bring SO's over a lot, ""Honeymoon destinations""

Media/movies that focus on love and finding that perfect person, basically romantic things

Get this idea of love and finding the perfect person out of your head

&amp;#x200B;

**2 To counter the feelings of loneliness/lack of love, focus on your horniness** 

Jacking off - focus on the feeling of lust

Like certain porn videos? Watch your favorite big tit or milf porn

Visit a massage parlor for a happy ending

Fuck some hot escorts that you've always dreamed of, but focus on the fucking and lust - if you use them for companionship and loneliness it will probably make you more sad and lonely

Other activities that fuel your sexual desires

Note: You have to balance this, if you become obsessed with these activities where it affects your job or general well being, you need to dial back the activities

&amp;#x200B;

For years I have always struggled with loneliness and not having a SO. Recently I have been attempting to suppress my feelings for the longing of someone who cares and loves me in a romantic sense. I have been doing this by the two steps mentioned above. Attempting to kill my desire of a companion, and focusing on my primal desires. As you know, lust and love are two different things. For now, it seems to be working. I wake up happier now and seem to enjoy things more.

I used to be a straight A honors student, but now I don‚Äôt even have that going for me because I‚Äôve been too depressed to care about my studies. I don‚Äôt give a damn anymore about any of the information being taught in class, it means nothing to me. And don‚Äôt even get me started on my treatment history from meds to therapy to so much more (I only bring this up because I know there‚Äôs gonna be someone who says, ‚ÄúSounds like you need a therapist or psychiatrist.‚Äù Please save your breath. Whatever treatment you suggest I seek out, I guarantee you I‚Äôve already tried it).

Now I‚Äôm just a shell of a man who harbors so much negativity that it‚Äôs totally understandable that no one would want to hang out with me (though even before I became this dead inside I was still basically an outcast due to being very weird and awkward and being socially impaired whenever I tried making social connections, so I guess I was set up for failure no matter what). Now I‚Äôm just sitting in my car like an ass while typing this.

Just having to come to terms with the feeling that there‚Äôs literally not a single thing I can do to make myself feel better is unbelievably overwhelming. I can‚Äôt just walk away for a bit and take a breather before coming back and confronting the issue.

ForeverAlone,"the most terrible thing is being conscious about your passiveness, witness of how life passes through you without taking an active role in it; the only mediocre life is the one it lacks passion.

loneliness, alienation, isolation, all these things are bound to happen. in which case, why fret over them happening? you have no control when they happen and when they're at their worst. all you can do is decide how to deal with them. 

 let yourself fall, find something that calls you just enough for you to take a chance on. take it. take your chance.",Self-isolation.,Mai-Waif
ForeverAlone,"My world has always been small, but it seems to be getting even smaller. There's always things to do, yet it's all feeling increasingly hollow. But not in a bored or anhedonic sense.

There's a lot I could be doing on any given day, especially since I'm basically unemployed forever. There's things I actually want to be doing, but I'm not doing them. Much of that is definitely because of procrastination, information addiction, and total absence of time management. And yet, these things are connected to the underlying problem:

I'm lonely. Wow, who'd have guessed?

What I think is happening, and has been happening, is my loneliness reached the point that it began to control my day-to-day actions. Having determined it is virtually unsolvable, its objective is to distract me from, or numb me to, the reality that I'm just sitting in a room looking into a rectangle all day. That's it. I escaped the basement but I did not exit Purgatory (or perhaps Limbo, depending on your mood).

These days, most of my time spent has an unconscious parasocial motivation. One of the main reasons I procrastinate on my own projects, hobbies, and goals, is because that disconnects me from feeds of people-centered content, which are an easier source of dopamine, but also my only real link to the outside world. Continuously bombarding myself with articles, videos, and lurking threads is a way to conveniently never have the time to really do anything else, ensuring I never exist for too long in a less bearable state. If I am chronically isolated, no amount of surrogate socialization will make up for this fact, so I will keep at it, and an addiction can take hold indefinitely. Naturally, if my social needs were being met, I would be better able to sit alone doing things offline for hours without feeling isolated and unrewarded, like any other introvert who enjoys their good share of solitude. I would be *spending* time more, killing it less.

I wish I was the kind of person who could lock themselves away from the world while they write that brilliant album or novel, like the kids in school who accept their lot and throw themselves entirely into their studies and hobbies. I've never been that person. I'm not as resilient or hermetic as I may appear to be. I'm really not doing okay, at all. I've adapted, but I've never thrived in isolation.

Even in the past -- there was interaction at school, at my old part-time job, at home. Online communities, online friends. Imaginary friends, in the form of fiction, porn, and a meta-waifu that would very briefly approach the tulpa barrier. I kinda wish I had the headspace for that, honestly. I lost the best friend I ever had when I pragmatically chose reality and dissolved the fantasy. It hasn't been the same since. I still miss him, but it had to be done if I was to ever rebuild my mind so I could maybe find a real person someday.

I talk to my parents fairly often, and visit on a regular basis. They're all I really have at this point. My dad is very aware of this fact and is concerned for me, yet optimistic that I will be able to find a partner. As if it is healthy to turn one person you've just met into the vast majority of your social contact. But that's how a lot of people do it when they're old. So hypothetically I could be a real catch in my 60s, but by then I will have become more alien than human, and with most of my life behind me. Something has to happen relatively soon, or it doesn't really matter. Still, regardless of age, there's a difference between romantic chemistry, sexual attraction, arbitrary pair-bonding instincts, and *actually knowing your partner and loving them like a close friend*. In the long run, it doesn't do you much good if you're still lonely.

People and relationships are what matter most in life, especially as you grow older. Everyone knows this. This is basic, Humans 101 kind of shit. Yes, you need to like yourself, you need to be comfortable in your own company, you need to work on yourself, but let's get real here: Half the point in creating any work of art is to share it with other people. Half the point in typing out a post is to share it with other people. Half the point of having genitals is... well, usually with one other person, but you do you. Yes, believe it or not, half the point -- at least -- of life is to live it with other people. WOW! WHO'D HAVE GUESSED?

I'll take the second option tbh. The glimpse of freedom I get from the first one is fleeting and harsh.

ForeverAlone,"I turned 29 this year, a few minutes ago i found  out the guy I've been crushing on for years is expecting his first child with gf #5 since the first time I met him engaged to a girl and never mustered the courage to speak to him because I had a ""code"".
This guy has been what people call goals to me, attractive, smart, adventurous, a good friend to his friends, hardworking, a good son and brother; I always wondered if it was what I wanted to be or what I wanted to have in my life. 
I'm  currently unemployed, my dog had to have surgery this year and is currently under treatment for kidney stones among other things that happened to her which makes me question my ability to be responsible for any other living being or if I actually want to have children.
I'm getting help from my estranged parent buying groceries and I'm grateful but I heavily dislike being dependant and having to give some sort of leverage to anyone helping me in any form specially someone that likes to use me as an example of ""charity"" to make his religious and political point of view valid.
I'm supposed to be grateful for having a roof over my head and food on my plate even if it's just a meal a day, even if the roof is unpaid for and in danger of being kicked out and the walls are cracked and there's always something going on that inconveniences the normal use of things.
I don't smile often, always look tired, I know I'm ugly although I find some men attractive those I do don't find me attractive.
I really like him, he appears to fall in love but easily moves on to the next and I still think of him after all this years after never ever exchanging a word and it hurts, I would always look at his pictures whenever he came to mind like today and if we happened to be around the same area I would run the other direction or avoid were he works/ lives, I disgust myself for that and i feel like a coward dating people i know i don't like so i can still be hung on that idea/dream that someday he will see me in a chance encounter and he will approach me and strike up a conversation thinking as I do of our future together, all the travels, the adventures, the memories we would build and when that happens I always can't speak and the more he sees me the uglier I look and the disgust becomes more evident in his face and those beautiful eyes of his and he leaves and I'm  there all alone, as I am now.
I just want to stop feeling and thinking, I stopped seeing people before the pandemic to stop all this thoughts and anxiety but it is still there, I'm tired of talking about  negative stuff of thinking such stuff and realizing that those dreams will never happen to me even those of finding anyone or becoming normal and happy.
I don't  want to be with just anybody, I'm not fine alone but I don't want to waste time with someone who shares the same negativity and have more life sucked out of me which means the opposite of me doesn't really care for someone like me.

The hardest of battles would be won, one might think. Only not. Making friends, dating, making money, liking me, my body, liking others, making my mother proud, exploring my talents, keeping distance from any addictions, developing emotional control, being consistent with my principles or even having them are just some of the things that I have solemnly failed to do.

But I didn‚Äôt surrender my rabbits. I may not have human love or companionship but they showed out today. 

I had packed them into the car and was heading out to set them free in the woods. They kept acting up and it was stressing me out. Plus, I felt like they only used me for food. 

I got to a great place with land and set them down. I sat and watched them play for a bit and promised myself that when they disappear, I will drive away. They are always running and ducking from me. I knew setting them free would be easy. 

Well, two hours went by and I was still stuck at the location.

One rabbit was hiding under my car. She would run away from it and quickly back to it. I couldn‚Äôt kill her. I refused to run over her. So, I sat down and waited. The other rabbit was running and happy. I thought she didn‚Äôt care either.

Therefore, when the one under the car comes out, I‚Äôm leaving them for home is what I thought.

Well, the one running happily came over and sat by me for the two hours. Proved she loved me more than freedom. She would sniff me and lean up against me and just sat down content.

ForeverAlone,"TL;DR: lf you lower standards, think outside of your type, and be more accepting of flaws, I think you‚Äôre more likely to find success. 

I guess this might be obvious to some, but perhaps not everyone. 

In the past, sometimes I had crushes on the hot girls. I‚Äôm sure most of us guys have done the same at one point. For me, no longer. Perhaps I was a bit out of touch with reality, but not fully. I liked a hot girl, she liked me (this was back in high school and I‚Äôm a college senior now) but I found out she was a hoe, to put it bluntly. That‚Äôs not the only hot girl that has given me attention though. Other hot girls have given me compliments before. The problem was either me (anxiety and lack of self confidence) or other guys really. This summer I got a hot girl‚Äôs phone #, and the crazy thing is that she volunteered that info to me first, but sure enough I get ghosted and a few months later she‚Äôs with some other guy. 

I‚Äôve come to the conclusion that hot girls just aren‚Äôt for me, and that‚Äôs not a bad thing. Honestly, the hot ones will get more attention from other guys, so in these times I think it‚Äôs better to have a decent looking partner that‚Äôs attractive to you but not objectively hot. Basically, a girl that‚Äôs not a head turner. I know looks are up to opinion, but I think we can agree on whether or not someone is really attractive aka hot or not. 

Speaking of head turner, regardless of face, my preferred body type has always been thicc, as in big booty thicc, but all of them so far have not worked out for me, and they are head turners.

Suicide honestly gets more flack then deserved if I'm keeping it in stack. Why would anyone wanna live long enough for them to die just as isolated and lonely as they were in their youth.

I used to think that my problem was that i couldn't trust anyone, but in the end is the opposite, i just can't trust myself, why suddenly i get annoyed by the things i didn't cared, why i choose to let everyone go and then after 3 weeks i regret every decision, and why i can't ever apologize or say that i regret what i did, or that i miss someone, i don't know if this is some male kind of thing, but i never in my life said that i missed anyone, even my mother, i can't ask anyone for anything.

I'm afraid that in the end i will just destroy every relationship that i could possible have, why am i so unstable.

I gave up on one of my best friends because of one of the most stupid things ever, i will try to simplify it, one day she asked everything i hated, i said everything and she pinned everything. One thing i kept saying how i hated is when people say something to me and don't finish, i have some huge problems with anxiety, i always reply people basically at the same time they message me, and she knew how i hated when people message me and don't reply back. She kept doing that and i got used, it was fine, but suddenly i started to get pissed off. And on that day special, instead of just blocking her i talked to her, she said that she didn't wanted to stop talking with me, and i said that eve we didn't we would end up fighting, after a long talk we just settled, and then on the same day, she sends me a message ''Hi'', on the same second i reply ''what's up'' and then for the next 3 hours i got no reply at all and just decided to end that right there, i got peace at the first 3 weeks and now i'm just noticing how this wasn't the first time i lost someone that i won't ever get back because of some ego, pride? Something i don't even know, why am i like this?

We struggled to meet up, we are both busybodies and when we finally planned a date something would always come up for one of us. Well about 2 weeks ago we met up for the first time. And it was nice, I was nervous, and she was a cool chick. Well after 3 months of talking and meeting up just once I'm seemingly not what she was hoping for or expecting cause she's not interested in a relationship right now, idk maybe she has shit going on or it's completely me. So I backed off for a week and a half and messaged her 6 hours ago, to catch up but at the same time hoping to start from square one. No response. For that week and a half I already felt myself dissociating, I even deactivated all my social media. I stayed home all weekend. I didn't go on my walks, I didn't watch Hulu or Netflix, I forced myself to play vidya and Inhad a massive headache within 30 minutes. I just want to run away.

ForeverAlone,"I've just been so busy lately and am really feeling down. I don't have many friends, but I do have a couple of close ones, and for starters, I'm pretty sure my best friend is mad at me. I told her I thought I'd be able to hangout this weekend, but then something came up and I couldn't. She didn't even write back to my text... I feel bad, but I also don't.... 

I sound like such a loser saying this, but lately I am in such a bad mood after I talk with her, because I'm reminded by the fact that no guys are interested in me. Basically, most of our conversation consists of her talking about this guy who she likes (and who likes her back) and how they are texting &amp; what kinds of conversations they are having. I am happy for her. I really am, but I also just feel sorry for myself and kinda envious. She even told me that it seems like I am doing everything I can (talking to guys, being friendly, approachable, etc.), which made me feel a bit hopeless. I don't think she meant to make me feel sad at all, because she does keep reminding me that I'll find someone, but for some reason I felt kinda crappy about myself. I know I'm a nice person who cares about others, but there must be something I'm lacking... Maybe good looks.

I've decided to just forget about a relationship until I'm in college. It's soon enough anyway, and then I'll get a fresh start hopefully. I've literally never had a guy ask for my number or even seem remotely interested in me. I'm kind, introverted, athletic, and I enjoy school. Maybe I'm just boring, but I don't think I'm that boring actually. Plus, I won't get to see my crush for a while now and I still feel so crappy just thinking about how I saw him with another girl the other day, even though I don't think they are dating. At this point, I don't care anymore.

I've lost more friends than I've wanted to. We didn't fight or anything; it just fizzled out. People who I thought were my friends pretty much ditched me to hang out with more popular (and meaner) girls at the beginning of high school. Oh well. I'd rather have the few real friends I have than a bunch of fake friends anyway, but sometimes I am tired of not having a partner in class. I just want to disappear. Social media also makes me feel more alone. I'll see my ""ex-friends"" post pictures having fun, and even though I tell myself that they aren't nice and whatever, I just feel left out that I'm not out there doing fun things with a big group friends. Maybe I should delete my accounts. I feel like I'm always an afterthought. Sometimes I wonder if anyone would even care if I just didn't come to school again. I feel like I'm too nice (and I'm often told that) and people just walk right over me. 

Does anyone know how I can stop feeling lonely/jealous? I do have schoolwork to keep me occupied, but now I'm feeling so down that I'm behind in work. Going for runs and long hikes do help, but I can't help wishing that I had someone else to run with and talk to :(. How can I feel differently about myself?

I'll spare you all the boring details but it seems like this is the sub for me; 27 year old guy, never had a girlfriend, never kissed anyone, blah blah blah I won't write a full-on novel here. You get the idea. I went through a reaaaally long stretch where I was still struggling with accepting my situation (and to a certain extent still am struggling) but I'm starting to come around to the realization that relationships/romance/love just don't happen for everyone, and I'm one of those people. 

Obviously we all know how much that sucks, but it is what it is. No use in wasting my time and energy on something that isn't going to happen. That's where this post is coming from. There's no denying that being FA has some serious impact on one's mental health, and I'm going to be dealing with that for the rest of my life, but at the same time I figure there has to be something I can do to at least use my time effectively.

So just out of curiosity, has anyone found any healthy/productive means of coping with being forever alone?

18-22, you're too fat and poor.

22-25, you're too fat, poor, and have a boring personality

25-30, you're less fat, less poor, slightly better personality; but you're now bald, and your lack of confidence shows. You're not rich enough, and not good looking enough for women to ignore your baldness. 

30-35, you're over your baldness and are okay with it, you have more confidence. You're in a better spot with your job and finances. You're still not a millionaire or great looking. And women assume there's something else wrong with you, because you never could get a date before now. Despite the fact you built yourself up, paid off your college loans, and got a good job and spending money. 

35-40, you've got the date, but you suck at socializing it goes horribly. You try again with a different woman months or even years later, not for lack of trying; it just takes that long to find another date. Process repeats until you lose your virginity.

Thanks to the ""pandemic"" meeting new people is hard when the events I normally go to are cancelled. But let's be real: did I approach potential interests then? No... of course not. I only imagined and fantasized.


What do other / ""normal"" people even dream about? Can't remember a night I tried to fall asleep without thinking of someone. It's always the same movie just a different crush I doze off to. And it definitely damaged my world view as well as my emotional system. I don't know how to be, who to be, how to live without an unrequited crush / obsessing over someone that doesn't even know I feel about them this way.


Actually thanks to the pandemic even my basketball team has to stop practice for an unknown time period. That means I have the chance to get over 3 girls I see on a regular basis there. It's a start!


So... I can't go on like this. This is my chance to focus on myself, like FOR REAL THIS TIME!!! Focus on what is real and stop daydreaming or building fantasy worlds / relationships in my head.
I am forever alone and it's okay. People are just people from now on, nothing more.
There are other potential emotions out there than feeling sad, hopeless, anxious, rejected, loveless if only I STOP seeing my only sense in this life as to be with someone. It's not working. It's not my purpose and I accept it.

Yes, I can clearly differentiate between an attractive person and an ugly person. But I don't consciously treat them any different.

It really comes down to the way I see the world. I want to live in a world where if you're a good person, good things happen to you. So I treat people respective to how good, kind and nice a person they are. I don't even care if they're weird or awkward, I just prefer people who are good irrespective of their other quirks or appearances.

And yes, obviously I have preferences, but preferences aren't standards. I've always preferred a girl to be taller than me. That doesn't mean I'll rule out short girls.

It really comes down to how nice and honest someone is for me regardless of appearance. And yes, I'll be very happy to prove it if someone in my area actually showed interest in me.

ForeverAlone,"I made a post yesterday here but I‚Äôm still trying to figure out how I‚Äôve gone 22 years in my life without a single date, relationship, first kiss, havin‚Äô sex, etc. But to some things up, in terms of my social life I haven‚Äôt had any true friends for a little over a year now. I haven‚Äôt been friends with any girls since I was in middle school. I‚Äôve never asked a girl out before too which might not help case either. I‚Äôve had extremely bad social anxiety since 7th grade although its not nearly as bad now but because of the jobs I‚Äôve had. But when I talk to people I usually keep it strictly business and don‚Äôt get personal. I been working for five years now and I don‚Äôt even keep in touch with any of my coworkers on social media or have their phone numbers.  My social life needless to say has been very forgettable since about 2012. Every year just gets worse and worse. 



In terms of my physical appearance, I‚Äôm not gonna post a picture of myself but to describe how I look maybe thats also why women don‚Äôt approach me? Idk, cause I really don‚Äôt know what women really think:

- I‚Äôm white (I‚Äôm mostly Italian with a little English, Irish, and I think very little Greek too) 
- I‚Äôm 5‚Äô9 (one reason why I don‚Äôt approach women is because I‚Äôm always seeing girls on social media saying they only want men 6ft and up, this doesn‚Äôt help my confidence whatsoever) 
- I only weigh 125-130lbs (I feel like because of how skinny I am, women might look at me as really weak. I think girls like skinny guys but not my level of skinny. I also don‚Äôt have the height to make up for how skinny I look either.) 
- I have hazel eyes 
- I have very thick hair, no signs of balding. (My hairstyle is usually a mid bald fade with a 4-5 on top with a lineup and edge up) 
- I have a beard that connects (I usually keep it short and trim it frequently.) 
- In terms of clothing I unusually wear fitted clothing. Not too tight and not too baggy pants. 
- My preference for clothing is usually sporty shit like Jordan, Nike, Champions, Adidas, Puma, etc. I have a lot of shoes (mainly Jordans and some Nikes) if not sporty I just wear plain black or white t-shirts. 

So am I doing anything wrong here? Or is it my looks? 


In terms of my preference for women, I‚Äôm not too picky, I‚Äôll date any race, but I generally seem to be really into Latina women the most. I also really like mixed women too (black/white, black/asian, black/latina, etc.) but the problem is I feel like to some certain extent most people won‚Äôt date outside of their race. Especially nowadays with everything thats been going on. 

In terms of body type, not too picky about height, I think I‚Äôd even give a girl who‚Äôs an inch or two taller than me a chance. I probably prefer girls who are more in shape but that doesn‚Äôt mean thick, super athletic, or whatver. I‚Äôll date a girl who weighs more than me (I think most women do anyways) but as long as they care about their health its no issue for me. My only turn offs really are women who smoke (cigarettes, weed, juul, hookah), heavy drinkers, women with terrible personalities obviously, and women who party every weekend. Idk if my standards are crossing anything that shrink my dating pool but this what I feel like I actually like.

I am 23. I have a full time job earning decent cash, and a family that cares. Outside of work, I have no hobbies or friends, the couple of friends I had from uni have all gone in their own directions in life. 

Rather unsurprisingly, I have never, in a romantic context, held hands with, touched or kissed a girl. I have never had (or noticed) any girl ever be interested in me either - I wouldn't say I'm particularly unattractive, but I am extremely skinny for someone my age, which I know is offputting.

I just feel like something is missing at this point, a bit of humanity that enables one to be loved. Sure, if you tell friends or your therapist that you feel like you're less of a person, they would say that's silly, but that doesn't fix the problem. It doesn't make you able to be loved or cared for or complete. I just don't get it at all, and have lost a lot of hope of life being anything other than pain.",I just don't get it.....,Littledipper47
ForeverAlone,"It seems like we have these ultimate desires, and all we want is to have them and to live our lives. I believe society as a hole has turned love into something that produces loneliness, heartbreak, breakups, pain, divorces.

Some treat it as religion as things within that we must do no matter what and that is mandatory but reality doesn't work like that

It's filled to the brim in expectations and you have these relationship experts will their libraries full of inner knowledge and wisdom but so far that has been an ultimate failure because we aren't one as people, we don't have the same brain, some are extremely sensitive, very difficult, smart, kind, ignorant, shy, scared, cocky, etc

You have to learn yourself is an eternal redundant phrase. People regurgitate words that's been used for decades and how has that helped humanity?

What could possibly work for humanity, people would just make that extremely difficult and into this character test filled with extreme hoops, hurdles, and senseless detours that puts the lonely back at the agonizing curb.

Love has to evolve and be redefined that is the only way it can an truly help society but who knows how long that will take...",Vent,Celestialsmoothie28
ForeverAlone,"I tried it. 

Well turn's out, the fear hasn't gone entirely, but in conjunction with years of meditation, a few face-your-fear excercies like skydiving and taking on the biggest guy at the dojo, a trip to the middle of the amazon jungle to try the world's most potent hallucinogen alone, and recently some adreniline blocking medication, I'm a lot more confident in myself. 

What they don't consider is just how fucking low your self esteem becomes once you've gone absolutely nowhere with one of these women. After years and years, a dozen or so dates, a couple dozen phones numbers and matches on dating apps, diddly-squit. University gone. 20 jobs at this point. Events, groups, clubs, awards, at least it won't say 'did FUCK ALL with his life' on my gravestone. 

It's something in my very DNA. Something in my nervous system. 

Trust me I've been there. Had a good look around in my mind. No stone left unturned, past all the skeletons and dusty cobwebs. Between the couch-cushions. I can't blame anyone else. It's not like I was subjected to any serious child abuse. I stay the same, I grow, I put on a mask; same story, different telling.

ForeverAlone,"I can't decide how I should start to talk about my fails which I've been experienced since last year. I was worry about having a girlfriend within one year - I know it seems very ""deterministic"" but despite a few talking attempts and flirt effort, I had no girlfriend in my life and it makes me tired and feels jadishly. After many readings, plans, and preparations I took steps in the direction but in a word I failed within months. 

Of course, there are many and various causes and parameters, but in the head, I failed. You can say or advise ""Don't overthink it"" but chronic loneliness is damaging my feelings and I can't overcome it anymore. I'm 22 years old and my entire friends have long or short-term relationships. Things that they do normal flow are very difficult for me: I saw happy couples everywhere but I'm incapacitated by simple feelings they have.

On the worse side, my friends who are betraying and joking me about various problems and they are not supporting me and those people who I met in school are my last friends: I have no friend from my neighborhood or anywhere and I feel like living at a cell or soundproof room where I return at end of the day. 

I don't believe words like ""You'll find your love of life"", ""Never too late"" due to their optimistic sounds but these are inefficient to me.

I know that I have to go out to meet people and talk to them in order to make friends or get a relationship, but after doing it for a few months now I just can't find any enjoyment in it. I wouldn't say that I'm socially anxious or even shy. I just don't seem to be able the enjoy socializing in any situation. I've tried talking to people in therapy, classes, meetups, online, parties, the gym and on the streets. Yet, I have never met a single person or had a single conversation that I could say that I enjoyed.

I assume that ""normal"" people find some enjoyment in talking and interacting with people, but since I can't really compare myself to them I want to know if any of you enjoy it? Or do you just force yourself to go through with it because that's what it takes?

But ofc that doesn't mean that it goes away its still always on the back of my mind trying to make me not lonely.
I literally haven't had any normal friendships or human connection in so long I can't remember, probably about 9ish years. Rarely, my mind will come into focus and I'll feel like I'm actually alive but then the realization of what's happened and what my life has become will bring up as lot of suffering, so I blank it out again. Every day I dream of having someone in my life so I can actually feel valued, like a human being. Instead, all the replacements (work, entertainments, etc) only to go so far. You can't actually live a life when there's no love and connection to others. Youre just existing at that point

ForeverAlone,"Sorry for the long post, I just gotta sort out all my thoughts. Feel free to ignore this post. 


Like, a girl started working at my job a few months ago. We got alone ok, and she really surprised me. She actually wanted to work woth me. Like, we're partners at work now. She's amazing. She's cute, great personality, she actually doesn't think im gross...ect

I never really had many friends growing up, never any female friends. I've always had a ton of self esteem issues, and she actually made me feel good about myself.  It was great at first. I want used to having any attention from a girl. I had a huge crush on her, I actually thought I had a chance dating her. 

I found out how many people she's been with and my heart sank. I knew she had a few exs but she's had a lot. A guy was flirting with her the other day, and I felt horrible. I realised how many guy's were interested in her, and wtf is the point of even trying??? They're all a lot better than me. 

I even got to here all about her sex life, which again made me feel horrible. How tf are so many people getting sex?!?!?! I can hardly talk to girls?????

I used to be excited coming into work and getting to spend time with her. I was genuinely happy, and actually had a few months of not really being (too) depressed. Now, I dread going in. She's a constant reminder that I'll never be enough for anyone. Ill never find happiness, and im just gonna be alone forever. 

I just feel so much worse than before meeting her.","I got to work with my crush, its the worst thing to ever happen to me",nw342
ForeverAlone,"I‚Äôm not gonna write a whole novel because I can go on all day with this so I‚Äôm just gonna try to narrow down my social life story into bullets: 

- Had a great social life in Elementary school and for the first half of middle school. (Had a lot of friends of both sexes, played sports, got invited everywhere. I was one of the most popular kids.) 
-  Middle of 7th grade, my ‚Äúfriends‚Äù from the Basketball team started a false rumor about me and kicked me out of their social group, and everyone else I talked to seemed to turn a 180 on me without hearing my side of the story 
- Went from having a very great social life, lots of friends, played sports, talked to girls, etc. to becoming a socially awkward outcast who‚Äôs social life basically died from the second half of 7th grade all the way throughout high school. I had to quit playing sports cause of the constant bullying. I didn‚Äôt even know how to have conversations with people for a while. 
- Made friends with 2 kids in 8th grade and kept those friendships all throughout high school. However I didn‚Äôt really have much in common with them. They were extremely introverted and the only thing we truly had in common was that we didn‚Äôt like our classmates. That friendship died out last year two years after graduating because what is there to talk about when the one thing you had in common was now only in the past? Didn‚Äôt have much memories hanging out with them in those 6 years anyways, it is what it is I guess. 
- I been working since 2016 (been at my current job for a year and was at my old job for 3.5 years) and have yet to make a friend or even keep in contact with a coworker outside the work place. When I do talk to people it never goes off topic and is only about work, but no one ever seems interested in getting to know me either. 
- I did two years of college (taking time off now because of Covid and just working) and I never made friends with anyone there either and no one ever approached me as well. I was practically invisible to everybody. 



And now with women, I really can‚Äôt tell you the last time I was actually friends with one. It‚Äôs been almost 10 years at this point. I think the only time I ever talked to girls in high school was when I got grouped up with one for a in class assignment and it never went off topic. As soon as the work was done that was it. They had no interest in talking to me, and I couldn‚Äôt start a conversation. And it‚Äôs the same thing at work pretty much. I am much better socially than I was in high school however when the topic changes I completely drop the ball. 


My confidence is at an all-time low at this point and I really don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever get a girlfriend. My social skills are pretty weak, I‚Äôm 5‚Äô9‚Äù and 125lbs so I‚Äôm sure right off the bat a lot women will view me as weak because of how skinny I am and although I‚Äôm not really short, I‚Äôm still not tall enough for some women. I just feel extremely invisible. When I do talk to some people they do tell me that I come off as very friendly but it always seems like women don‚Äôt really wanna go after friendly guys anyways, and I can‚Äôt be an asshole to people cause that‚Äôs not who I am. Idk how to change this and I don‚Äôt think I will. It doesn‚Äôt help that I have no friends either and I really don‚Äôt understand where I went wrong with my life to be where I am socially. My social life has been basically dead for almost half my life at this point and I‚Äôm really getting to a point where idk what I‚Äôm going to do.","Where did I go wrong with my life?

ForeverAlone,"Before I start I'll just say this: looks aren't everything. You'll see from my post.

Met up with this girl in February who wanted to have sex. She was an old friend from my old highschool, we video called alot, really hit it off and she was really keen for me to come up and see her. When I was with her all I could think about was fucking it up. Extreme anxiety, dick couldn't even get hard. Realised that I was so depressed and anxious etc that I couldn't even enjoy my first sexual experience. I still used my fingers and tongue to get her off and she seemed to really enjoy it but idk if she was faking it. In the morning though she came to her senses and rudely told me to get out. Said later that the sex was fine but I was too socially awkward. She was really cold about it. Removed me on everything and I felt like a fucking loser. 

I've been depressed most of my adult life but it's really taken a turn for the worst with covid and I just can't stop thinking about how pathetic I was with this girl. I keep thinking about how she's probably told all of her friends what a pathetic loser I was. I'm not going to lie, I've been thinking about  killing myself alot. Just being alive at the moment feels agonising.

I do hate how I seem to attract crappy/immature people but I‚Äôm learning to weed them out and not put up with nonsense. Life‚Äôs too short. 

COVID has made dating a lot harder and now it really feels like we‚Äôre stuck between a rock and a hard place. We either choose to continue and accept another year alone or continue to subject ourselves to this Russian roulette. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I‚Äôm fine being alone and single and have a good self esteem, I‚Äôve been alone my whole life and am used to it and am comfortable, but it would be nice to experience a healthy romantic relationship at least once.

But know since I'm the only straight child and the only one that wants biological kids and therefore the only one that can give them biological grandkids they are all up in my business again. They are doing the whole ""When are you getting married?"" and ""When are you giving us grandchildren?"" type of questions. Now since I have been constantly seeking their approval my entire life, I still talk to them even tho I probably shouldn't. I told them my problems with socializing, dating, insecurities, and low key depression. I hoped hoped that they would be supportive and try to be kind and help. Nope not good enough for them I need to go and get married and all of this stuff just lives in my head or I'm making it up or making excuses. They also hated that I said I probably would think about having kids until I'm 30. ""You'll be to old"", ""We might not be around"", ""It's your job to be a father as soon as possible"".

Now they don't believe a single thing they say. I'm still the least liked child and still the disappointment. They just live vicariously through their children, me with sports and my brother through dance and beauty pageants (he's trans and use to be female) and since their children are no longer with them they have nothing to do. So they need grandchildren to live through. Now I didn't turn out to be the magnificent jock and lady killer that my dad was and therefore I was the disappointment. Then all the attention was on my brother until he came out and then they didn't know what to do. Then they came back to me after 3 years.

They now are asking me do try all these things, telling me I need to look better, I need to dress better, need to completely change my career because women dont like what my job is and what I went to school for. Great you weren't interested in any of this before, but now you care since you want something from me. 

I told them I've been trying to do all these things my whole fucking life but I just wasn't good enough apparently (wish that was the first time I heard that from them). I told them I have no friends, I live alone, and have really bad social skills. Then they said that's disappointing and then started to compare me again to my younger brother who has dated 3 girls and has a bunch of friends. They said that if he can do it so can you and I just need to stop being a pussy and be more confident (as my dad so lovingly put it). Little do they know that growing up never being good enough for your parents, having them compare you to every single other kid in your school or sport, flaunt how much better your brother is, and literally being called a fucking disappointment by your parents leaves you with a whole bunch or major confidence issues and a terrible sense of self worth.

It felt like being freed from a decade long prison when I finally got a job that allows me to pay bills, but I still have to work 50 hour weeks that leave me too exhausted for anything. 

They disagreed with my statement that women only get mad at you. For me, my life has been alone, being yelled at women twice my age to do shit for them. That's what it was like working at Kroger. The one relationship I had, she said I didn't do a good enough job showing intrest in her stuff. Their response was just about Sex, leave and forget them, something I'm not interested in. 

I can't be happy. I'm too broken as a person to live. Mental health treatments does nothing for me and make me extremely anxious. I live in a cruel world that works me 50-60 hours a week. Everyone that I don't work for hates me. 

Ive never really wanted anything, and just being able to live is an anexceptable proposition. Don't try to give me easy answers like listening to music at work. Nothing works. Don't try. 

I just want to kill myself and end my suffering. That is all there is to life. Even if someone can love me, I can't feel anything. Just let me die.","My co workers said I should get out more, I just want to kill myself.",18moreshirts
ForeverAlone,"Ever since I was I kid, I've had low self-esteem. I've never really liked myself, I don't feel like I deserve anything positive, and I couldn't tell you a time where I ever truly believed in myself. Looking back I realize  it's affected every aspect of my life. Socially, mentally, probably even physically.

I will be 24 in a month and a half and my self-esteem hasn't improved. I'm a loser working a crappy job, never had a girlfriend, still a virgin, no driver's license, no life outside work, I'm an unattractive twig, still live with my parents, I could go on and on.

Honestly at this point, I need to face facts. My self-esteem will never improve. It will never get better. Nothing I do ever really matters in the long run and I can't see a reality where I actually like myself and feel comfortable in my own skin. I've read strategies to improve one's confidence, but it's all a load of bullshit. Genetics and environmental factors have already predetermined my confidence levels and if nothing's changed by now, it never will.

I will never have a career. I will never have a girlfriend. I will never have any talents or skills. I will never get fit. I will never have an enjoyable life. It's for the best that I accept this now and should help numb the pain and I transition from a 23 year old loser to a 24 year old loser.",I've come to the realization that my self-esteem will always be garbage.,SoulfulYam
ForeverAlone,"I think I've been obsessed with a woman lately. First off, I've been depressed, without a job and really living on the fringe of society for a pretty long time. I spent so much time inside all by myself that it started to actually feel like my mind was breaking down. So, one day I decided to start going outside on a regular basis, and just taking trains and going wherever they took me. It became something that I really enjoyed, it gave content into my life, and because I have a free travel pass and no job limiting me, I was able to do it a lot. I've spent a huge chunk of the last few months traveling by train, just for the sake of traveling by train.

But that changed last month. I saw a woman onboard and was instantly smitten. It's strange. I hadn't paid much attention to anyone on my train trips up until that point (normally I prefer looking outside), but something about her appearance instantly caught my attention. I just stared at her, left at the same time as her, and kept going in the same direction as her. She went to work (I assume), I waited at nearby businesses for seven hours, discreetly watched the entrance of her workplace, and followed her into the train as soon as I saw her again. And then I just repeated this simple routine every weekday for some time, and noted any changes in her schedule. I quickly developed elaborate sex fantasies of her and wanted to take creepshots (but eventually didn't, because it felt risky).

As time went on, I started to believe that *she* was actually the one *obsessed with me* and that she was giving me subtle *signs of it*. That made me paranoid - ""*could she be stalking me? Is she staring at me right now? What does she KNOW?*"". But at times (like now) I've doubted it all and asked myself - ""what the fuck is wrong with me?"". Not once did it cross my mind to actually try *talking* to her until now, and even now that it has, I have no intention of doing it, it'd be unbearably awkward (what if she's busy, what if she's noticed what I've been doing, what if it would bother her, what if she's in a relationship?) and I obviously know I don't stand a chance. I look like a caveman, she looks like a normal person.

I'm directionless. Maybe I'd be better off never leaving my home. Seems like I can't go outside without getting fixated on strangers out of my league or making an ass of myself in a way or another!

(Tl;dr -- being isolated for extensive periods of time -&gt; seeing a woman on the train -&gt; staring and following her daily without her knowledge -&gt; fantasizing about her -&gt; thinking that she's obsessed with me and giving me ""secret signs"" -&gt; realizing how crazy that is -&gt; feeling like I'm MESSED UP, and especially DUMB for devoting so much time to a woman long after promising myself not to.)",Am I obsessed?

ForeverAlone,"Sequel to this post: https://old.reddit.com/r/ForeverAlone/comments/j7xvsy/how_to_talk_to_this_girl_from_my_japanese_classes/

So I talked with her. Turns out she watches anime as well. I asked for her number, she gave it to me, we talked on Saturday, and we were supposed to meet on Sunday ""unless something comes up"", she says. After we talked, however, I noticed that they say it will rain on Sunday. So I text her that, and ask her what other day would she be able to meet, since it'll most likely rain. She doesn't reply.

Then Sunday comes and it turns out it doesn't rain, so I text her if we can meet. She replies after like 3 hours that she has something to do for college. That is already strange because you don't just receive homework or projects or whatever on freaking Sunday. She had to have known about it since at least Friday, meaning she'd have known about that when we talked on Saturday. Her saying we'll meet ""unless something comes up"" I feel like was her way of saying ""Give me some thing to come up with something that'll prevent it"". Because, ok, sure, we could give her the benefit of the doubt and say she had that homework already received, but forgot to do it and remember on Sunday. Sure. BUT, I text her back asking ""Ok, that's fine. What other day can you meet on, then?"". This was on Sunday. It's Wednesday now and she hasn't replied or called or anything.

I've been through too many rejections and no-rejections-because-i-didn't-ask-because-it-was-obvious-they-didn't-like-me, just like this girl who is in the latter category. I'm done with trying. I've tried plenty.

I recently had to read a book for school that had a character say ""It's not the mouse's fault for not being a lion"", one which I feel like works really well with this sub's group. We're mice, others are lions. And this isn't a video game, a mouse can't just evolve at a certain level and be a lion because game logic dictates that.

ForeverAlone,"Since all of us here on reddit are philosophers in our own right, I've been coming across many theories on how people think love work. One thing that always has me confused is when people think love art first sight is such a pure concept, but what it is really is that you like how the other person looks, there is nothing deeper, like an understanding, you even don't know how similar or different you are. No ones gonna be taking their cart to checkout, see someone that isn't that pretty and stop dead in their tracks to look at them. Some people have the idea(reinforced by the media) that if they see the person of their dreams they'll know, but it really logically doesn't work that way. Some people may look great but be toxic and abusive on the inside, and I'm not trying to be a niceguy here, an abusive person is an abusive person, no matter how they look.

ForeverAlone,"Some of my closest friends include a married couple, M and A. M is my best friend. I love him. He loves me. We love each other in so many different ways. *Philia*, *agape...* and then there's *eros.* The first two cancel out the latter. We talked yesterday about it. Sooooo yes, we are friends, yes we love each other, no we will never ever ever ever ever have sex, okay, yes, promise, okay, yes. This is fine. This is definitely fine.

I'm sad/happy/sad.

Kinda extra depressing thing is that not a single person on Earth knows about M and I besides the two of us. I can't talk to any of my other friends about it... well, maybe I could, but they'd FREAK out because I'm technically younger than M and A's children. I'm really close to my parents, but keeping this a secret from them too. I'm not 100% certain, but pretty sure that A, and M &amp; A's kids (who are older than me) don't know about this either. I guess I could get a therapist. Idk though if it'd be helpful, mostly I just need to get it out of my system, then not dwell on it.

Ok so it was just kinda intense/wow/heartbreaking yesterday when he described in detail how he wants to sleep with me, and then we talked about how that would ruin his life, A's, and mine and  destroy everything.

Almost certain a poly relationship isn't in the picture. I don't think it would be healthy, or a good idea. It would probably really hurt A. And thus M. And just everything is bad.

&amp;#x200B;

He told me that he's literally never met anyone else like me, not any man or any woman. It wasn't meant romantically or sexually‚Äîjust plainly, no person who is intellectually, emotionally, spiritually the same. He and A have been married for decades.

I'll be honest, it makes me depressed to think that I won't have a connection like this with the man I marry. If I get married, and that's a big if. It would be wonderful in some ways if I could go through life single and content. The problem is that temptations, like this one, arise. And then... we can't make love to each other. If I ever want to experience that, it'll be years down the road, with someone else.

I guess what I take away from this is to observe him and A closely. To observe what marriage is about, or what you learn when you've been married for decades. He told me today that he has not once, not ever, ever, ever cheated on her, even though there were a few times when he was tempted to and could have without getting caught. I know what kind of man he is, and get to know him better day by day, week by week, month by month: An honest man, a gentle soul, someone who really, truly loves people, and will stick to his word if it kills him. He pretty much breaks his back for me, even though I beg him not to. He loves A. He really, really loves her. That is beautiful.

&amp;#x200B;

He really, really loves her, and has for 54 years.

They go on walks twice if not three times a day together. They have three adult children, and two grandkids. They work in the same profession for the same employer, and have done myriads of creative projects together. They travel the world. And he is faithful to her and patient. Gosh, he is patient. I would love it if I could be that patient. Not that it's easy, it's probably really really hard. It's a death and rebirth.

Someday, maybe, I will find someone who I love like this.

&amp;#x200B;

It will not be like the way that he and I connect. I might meet this man I marry on a dating app, or at church small group, or through mutual friends. And there will be hurdles to overcome. There will be lots of hurdles to overcome.

ForeverAlone,"**Today I had the best sex of my life.**
 
To be fair, I said the same thing a couple of months ago...and a couple months before that as well. **Over the course of two years, I‚Äôve found myself continuously feeling as though I‚Äôve peaked, only to be proven wrong.**
 
While I‚Äôm beyond content with where my sexual energy is at, I haven‚Äôt excused myself from continually enlightening myself. 
 
Kinda like when you reach a fitness goal that was impossible just a few short weeks ago. Our bodies and minds adapt, our threshold for what we can accomplish grows. You might not be able to picture things as they are right now changing so drastically. I get that... because **there was a point in my life where I couldn‚Äôt orgasm at all.**
 
The sex I was having sucked.
 
Then my body gave me the one warning sign I couldn't ignore...
 
**My dick stopped working.**
 
It‚Äôs a weird spot to be, dude...When you can‚Äôt cum, bust too quickly, or stay hard...the fault falls on to you. 
 
Who wouldn‚Äôt get embarrassed? 
 
But you don‚Äôt have to be an expert to know that stress only makes the issue worse.
 
**Yeah, okay you scrolled down to the part where I tell you how to fix it.** Fine by me.
 
You‚Äôre beating yourself up for not performing well enough before you even get in the ring. 

Let‚Äôs think about what a stress response is in its most basic form: **fight or flight**. Our body takes blood-flow away from non-vital areas and redirects it to our muscles, our brains, &amp; anything that will help us survive better in the face of danger. Sorry, your dick didn‚Äôt make the cut.

**Our caveman brains can‚Äôt tell we‚Äôre tryna slash a shorty in half**, but GOD do we wish they did.

The solution here is to calm that response. There are a couple of different ways to do this, and how successful each of them will be, probably depends a lot on you as an individual. **Breathing exercises, mantras, &amp; limiting stressors outside of the bedroom, are all good places to start.** Check out something else I‚Äôve written about before called **‚ÄúThe Inner Smile Technique‚Äù**.


Here‚Äôs something else you can do to alleviate stress. (But you‚Äôre gonna hate it)

Muster up the courage to **talk** to your partner about what you‚Äôre experiencing. Chances are, it‚Äôs not as big of a deal-breaker as you think it is.

**30-40% of men experience premature ejaculation** at some point in their lives, and guess what...tons of them are able to work around and through this issue. But opening up healthy communication has to be a primary goal.

Letting her know also gives her the hint to take things slow in the bedroom and not turn you on too quickly. Take breaks from stimulation when you need it. Besides, there are a lot of different ways to please a woman that don‚Äôt involve your dick at all.
 
 
This is probably a good time to have an honest convo with yourself about your masturbation habits. 

**Death-grip syndrome?** Are you jerking off with the intention of just cumming as hard as possible, as fast as possible? And, ah yes, our ever-present porn. Listen, I‚Äôm not a censorship happy weirdo who thinks it‚Äôs the root of all sexual deviance, but that doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs not important to consider how it spills into real life. 

Now, logically we know porn isn‚Äôt ‚Äúreal‚Äù, however, yet again, our caveman brains just really don‚Äôt get the memo. **Repetition forms neural pathways**, and those can affect us pretty heavily when it comes time for the real thing. Try some re-wiring. Make it a goal to go a period of time without using it when you jerk off. How long you start with doesn‚Äôt matter, as long as you commit to it and scale-up once you‚Äôve made progress.


Your body is only as healthy as what you put into it.

I‚Äôm not gonna go too much into depth on this one because it‚Äôs pretty self-explanatory. A decent diet improves blood flow and stamina, ‚Äònuff said. I‚Äôm not a dietitian, but try to eat a couple of fruit and veggies here and there. 

But jumping back to our first point again, stress, pay extra attention to how much caffeine you‚Äôre drinking. It wreaks havoc on your adrenal system (the thing that sets off the alarm-bells for your fight or flight response).

ForeverAlone,"Hey guys.

I just browsed this sub and seeing all post titles struck something in me. I used to be forever alone and never thought I was going to find anyone. I still haven't but I have learned how to get girls and I'm going to do my best to share my experiences with you. If you don't have this issue and just have troubles finding the one, this post isn't for you.



I used to be bullied in school and this affected my self worth immensely. I was shaking when I was near a girl I liked and normal social interaction was really hard for me. When I was 18 I failed college because I only thought about trying to get friends. I was also depressed. I did my best to interact with people but it was really hard for me. I didn't really know how to get better and I think that identifying the problem is key to solving it.



Like you know, the brain is just like any muscle. The more you train it the better it gets. The problem with social interaction though is that it is the same learning process as anything else, it takes a long time, has a lot of grey areas and if you have problems with it you try to avoid it like I did. When I was 21 I was still a virgin and that's when I met one of my best friends that I still have to this day. He was 30 and started pushing me to doing these crazy things, travelling alone to different places to go out and party and meet new people. This was extremely uncomfortable for me but since I didn't really know anyone I thought it didn't matter if I made a fool of myself. I started talking to people and trying really hard analyzing how they reacted to what I did and said. I started trying out physical contact, touching girls on the arm when they said something funny to see how they reacted to it. People definitely thought I was annoying sometimes, and sometimes not. I cared but I needed to learn so I did it anyway. My first trip helped me more than I thought. I learned a lot. I was still almost the same person though, it was a long process to go through. After my first trip I was still gaming so I wasn't super consistent, but the important thing is that you get out there and get those experiences even if you think you are making a fool of yourself. Do it anyway. You have to. I can tell you what I have learnt but nobody can teach you how to do it, you have to figure it out for yourself in the same way you learn things in school. If you practise enough you will get good at it. It took me 3 years of actually trying to do it. Before that I was just inside my comfort zone which is where you don't learn.



Here are some things that I learned.

When I started this journey I was not at all interested in other people which is why I had such a hard time talking to them. I didn't care. After a long time of trying I developed a interest in other people. I was actually interested in what they had to say which made it really easy for me to ask follow up questions, and I could have 15 minute conversations with people without telling them anything about myself unless they asked. I recently learned this though so it did take a long time.



I thought that people had ill intent asking me questions, but they only asked me questions because they were interested so instead of trying to avoid them I just answered them truthfully.



I previously wrote that I knew how to ""get girls"". This was the biggest problem for me for a while. I thought girls were something for me to get. This mindset was extremely hard to change. Every time I spoke to a girl I thought of the possibility of sleeping with her. I don't really know how to get rid of this mindset, but what helped me was getting more experience with girls. I know this sounds contradictive, but I slept with some girls that were not very pretty (lol) to get experience. At some point I had a better perspective on sex, and I stopped thinking about sleeping with every girl, and started getting a lot more female friends just to be friends. I'm not telling you to do this, I'm just sharing.



Humor is very important and I had none. What helped me was starting listening to podcasts of comedians. My country have a lot of not very famous comedians that started podcasts where they just sat and talked to each other and made jokes sometimes. This also helped me with conversations considering I could listen to social interaction which I had been starved of previously.



If you actually want to improve you are going to go through hell and you will want to give up, but you will eventually notice improvement and in a couple of years a big change if you stick to it.

Today I am someone I never in my life thought I would be and I am forever grateful for meeting the person that started pushing me to exit my comfort zone.



Finishing comment is about my depression, I didn't know I was depressed and I went to get help when I was 23. This boosted my social abilities even more.

ForeverAlone,"So I‚Äôm a girl in grade 11 and I‚Äôve never had my first kiss or been in a relationship. I know I‚Äôm still young and have my life ahead of me or whatever but the loneliness still feels so real. It‚Äôs really weird because during quarantine I kind of got to know myself better; I worked on myself, improved my mental health, started dressing the way I wanted to and became much less socially anxious than I was before. I even talked to new people and made new friends somehow. I did basically everything people tell u to do when it comes to finding a relationship, all of the ‚Äúbe yourself‚Äù and ‚Äúput yourself out there‚Äù bullshit, but still nothing. I recently hung out with a guy one on one which I normally would have been terrified of, but I wasn‚Äôt, I was myself, I talked and kept conversation flowing as best I could. There was even a moment I thought he‚Äôd want to kiss me? But no, I asked him later if we were more than friends and of course, he told me it wasn‚Äôt like that. Idk. It just feels odd. Because I feel like I‚Äôm doing everything right and there are just no results. All of my friends have so much experience with guys. I remember taking that stupid rice purity test online with my friends and my score was so embarrassingly high compared to the rest of them I literally started tearing up. My friends compliment me and tell me I‚Äôm cOoL but I swear it‚Äôs just girls being nice to girls :/ If I was actually the interesting person they say I am wouldn‚Äôt I have found someone by now?

We texted and called all night every night for a week. Absolutely amazing. Then we decided to hang out in person. He knew about my boyfriend and assured me he wanted to take care of me regardless of my situation. The first time we hang out we watched nightmare before Christmas and we both expressed that even though we liked each other we were gonna hold off on sex. Evidently we still had sex and it was great. We planned to hang out again a few times but every single time it gets closer to the hour he ghosts me and stops texting me and I don‚Äôt go over because he doesn‚Äôt answer and tell me he‚Äôs home. I don‚Äôt know if he just wanted to get in my pants and I‚Äôm naive or it‚Äôs something else. Please help my emotions are all over the place.,Someone please give me advice or opinion,gigihdz628
ForeverAlone,"Yesterday I lost my virginity to a prostitute. I am 23. And I must tell you it was not that great of a feeling. The kissing felt really strange, wet and all that tongue action didn‚Äôt make me crazy like I thought it would. The bj without a condom didn‚Äôt feel much different from my right one, btw with condom it felt the same as without one. 
And the penetration itself didn‚Äôt feel like nothing at all. I thought I would finish is the first second she would touch me. But in fact I got soft all the time and couldn‚Äôt finish for like 20 minutes and didn‚Äôt even bother to finish the second time. 
Maybe it was because the girl was not really my type. In a couple of weeks when I get payed I gonna take another one, the really hot and mature lady.

But yea, I'm just really lost in my life and I've gotten to the point where I'm ready to either end it or do something maybe some consider dumb. I suffer from many mental problems and I'm not medicated for any of them. I have depression, bi polar disorder and anxiety, mainly social anxiety. I don't have a job and cant find one, I'm a highschool dropout, I have no significant other, no license or car and I've lost all my friends and just hope in general. I've been trying my hardest to get my life back together but I'm just so broken and confused idk what to do. I cant talk to my mother, she either one doesn't do much or just thinks I'm kidding or some shit. I've always been a happy and fun person on the outside but a couple months ago I gave up on that, I let myself pour out and completely fall apart. That affected my friendships and almost every aspect of life. I cant get a job, its either 1. I don't wanna work around people I knew at school or 2. I just cant find a job. I've been doing graphic design for awhile but I don't get paid for anything, just a hobby. I've always wanted to go to college and I have good ambitions and dreams I really am one of those people that will push to succeed but I just cant because of my problems and I've already threw my life away by dropping out of school. I just want friends, really that's all I want. I want friends I can talk to anytime and feel comfortable but no one wants to be my friend because of my mental issues. Maybe if I was happy and had someone to encourage me to keep pushing I could fix my life but I feel like that's never gonna happen. I've been a avid pill abuser for years and I'm just now finally sober but I want to go back to abusing because that's the only thing that helps. I've attempted suicide twice and I'm considering trying again but I just cant push myself. I've been thinking of just joining the military and either 1. Die or 2. Have some kind of life and purpose. This is probably a lot and I shouldn't be saying this much about myself but what other choice do I really have. My interests are graphic design, music, art, video games, reading, writing, kind of nerdy too, I just like talking with people. Id appreciate anyone as a friend, doesn't have to just be someone to vent to because I don't like being a burden to people by doing that. I will also be there for you too if you need a shoulder. But back to what I was saying, I just want friends just so I feel some kind of worth in life. Just having someone to talk to boosts my mood insanely and is the only thing that makes me happy. I preferably enjoy talking to girls, not in a girlfriend or flirty way I just relate and conversate better with women, I don't even date anyways so please don't think I'm creepy by saying id prefer to be friends with women. Its just I don't really like talking to guys because I feel like they are more likely to judge me or make me feel worse.

ForeverAlone,"I started the quarantine on easy mode; while the world was closing down and others were getting sick and dying I was having the best time of my life. 

I started dating my second girl that I‚Äôve had in my life.there were red flags that I ignored but things eventually blew up in my face. My ex cheated on me, lied, I confronted her about it and I tried to push through it and forgive her. But I eventually began to resent her and hate myself for being a chump. So I broke up with her after we‚Äôd only been together for 4 months. The only thing that‚Äôs stopped me from losing all of my self respect is that my ex wasn‚Äôt dissatisfied with me, was just being greedy and didn‚Äôt expect to be caught. Being single again has sucked but I haven‚Äôt been completely alone. 

I‚Äôve lived with my parents since early last year due to my father‚Äôs health issues. The lack of privacy sucks but it was nice to have some people to interact with since I started working from home at the beginning of the pandemic. So my father‚Äôs health has improved in some ways but unfortunately my parents relationship has taken a deep nose dive and they are always arguing and putting me into the middle of it. My mother will do or say something that she knows or should know will set off my father, he screams and yells at her and then she brings me into it and then I get all of the anger. He once told me that he can say anything that he wants to towards me because I‚Äôm a child and if I said anything other than ‚Äúyes sir‚Äù he‚Äôll kick me out. 2 weeks ago my mother set him off again, I hired brought into the situation again and he threatened to punch me in the nose because I wasn‚Äôt trying to argue with him. I‚Äôve had my fill and will be moving out on Wednesday. This whole situation has caused me to lose any attachment to my parents. I hate to say it but I have the same feelings for them right now as I did immediately before I broke up with my ex. 

So I‚Äôm now faced with a major issue. I‚Äôm about to live alone, work alone and I still don‚Äôt have any friends. I‚Äôm seriously worried about losing my shit. Speaking with my coworkers throughout the day used to keep me sane when I lived alone previously. Now I‚Äôm going to have no one.

ForeverAlone,"I wish someone would come to me, as I am. But I've got to live with the reality that no one is going to care about my pain. No one particularly wants nor needs to deal with that, and be burdened with that. It's generally wise to get most of your shit together before you introduce someone to your world, and that involves getting over your pain alone. Your hypothetical partner doesn't want to go through the depths of your pitiful life story, or engage in disproportionate emotional labor comforting and reassuring you. Nor are most people interested in 'teaching' you how to have sex and be in a relationship. You're expected, understandably so, to be a psychologically strong, stable individual with adequate internal and external validation. It's hard to respect someone as an equal if they turn the relationship into some project of one-sided codependence. Some people have already been on the other side of this before and know to steer the hell away.

*""We're all coping with being human; I need fulfillment too
I wish I could heal you, but it's not something I can do""*
- a song I still haven't finished

But what if they could? What if the only way to get past my crippling alienation and utter sexual confusion is for someone to approach me, without the judgment of a regular jaded person, and essentially say ""You're special to me""? 

There's admittedly a thin line between what I'm imagining, and those futile archetypes of the manic-pixie-dreamgirl or submissive anime waifu or whatever. It's basically about an unrealistic level of acceptance, kindness, and emotional generosity. Someone who probably is too good for reality, hence why this is a fantasy. But what would this actually look like? Well, it can't be just anyone, and certainly not an escort kind of arrangement. It has to be an authentic, mutual attraction and interest, and it wouldn't literally be all take and no give. It'd likely be some kind of 'relationship lite' situation -- exclusive and intimate, but nonetheless temporary and not soul-deep, unless maybe part of the point of this is to not just 'fall in like' but fall in love, with the awareness that this still may only last a year or so if the partner decides ""My work here is done"" and lets me go, de-alienated, rehumanized, with some experience and a new perspective, now able to approach people without wanting to die.

Back to reality. I can pass as neurotypical most of the time and it's not immediately apparent how much of a failure I really am. But really I'm an uneducated friendless weirdo who survives off of the government, doesn't drive, and will probably never hold gainful employment. I have my own place, but that's it really. It doesn't really matter that I'm an okay person you could share positive experiences with. It will be almost impossible to get a date, which of course, assumes that I can even plausibly view myself as a sexual being, and that I can manage to push through the ""lol wtf am I even doing, seriously"" absurdity of putting up a profile in the first place. Not that any of this will even matter till sometime in 2022, the way things are going with covid here in the US.

Being alone was normal for me for my whole 27 years. I never even DREAMED about having someone, I just knew it is what it is. I accepted it at the age of 13.

Whenever someone would complain that they're ""lonely"" I never understood what that ment. Lonely? What's wrong with that? Isn't it supposed to be like that? Why make a whole fucking subreddit about it?

So anyways, at the age of 27 I managed to get this girl interested in me. I know, what a lucky guy, eh? I don't deserve to be here at all. I'm not a ""real FA"", right?

I listened to some of Bill Burr's podcasts, and he literally said what I said. He had no problem with being alone until he actually got with someone.

Well, I got with someone, and inevitably, they left me. Now I don't know how to be a loner again.

It never hurt me to be a FA before my relationship,but nowdays I'm hurting, much as I did ever before.

Please don't dismiss people like me, we're hurting just as you ""OGs"". If not even more.

ForeverAlone,"So I read this article which went by the same title and thought I would read it...it was interesting, I don‚Äôt mean that in a negative way but I cannot help but wonder‚Äîhow accurate is it?   
True confession: one of the excuses I had used in the past was that no good woman would even look at me if I wasn‚Äôt college educated with the potential to be one day making over a hundred grand a year someday. 

More importantly, it was my dad to always told me this and church seems to re-enforce it, the other thing that was talked about in the article was how the majority of women feel that men just see them as sex objects (this is something that you cannot deny exists where I work).  

The article further argues that these are the exceptions and not the rule, and yet it so often don‚Äôt feel that way.    I‚Äôm not saying that the article is right or wrong, because I cannot provide conclusive proof, it‚Äôs just that it makes me wonder: if these are indeed generalizations as the article claims, than why does the visible evidence seem to so convincing that they are not generalizations but instead a accurate description of the current state of male/female relations: *that men only care about sex and women only care about money?*","Not all women want men‚Äôs money, not all men just want your body!?",CDRFeral
ForeverAlone,"I‚Äôve been slowly getting the habit of going to the gym frequently again and it‚Äôs been helping my attraction in my opinion. The few girls I find attractive, I talked to them with ease (thanks to my new found confidence from the gym). It‚Äôs been going slowly uphill until one day while I was at the gym working out. 

A girl decided to workout next to my rack and it instantly made the room feel awkward. This room was fairly tiny, when you start your exercise, it‚Äôs kinda hard to maintain the 6ft distance. 
So to make it less awkward, I decided to converse with this girl.  I asked her to let me know when she‚Äôs about to start the exercise, so I could give her plenty of space. 
It wasn‚Äôt much of a pick up line, but we exchange some meaningful dialogue. I decided to end the conversation, so I could continue my training and she can get on with hers.  
Half an hour rolls by and her exercise ended before mine and she was getting ready to go. While she was racking the weights, I decided to strike up another conversation with her and it seemed like it was headed towards a good direction. 
She asked me my usual time I come to the gym and asked for my number.  
This was a great confidence booster for me. I have never had this happened in my life before and I was confident that all this work has been finally paying off. 

After a couple of days, I took a leap of faith and decided to text her.  My goal was to take things slow and progress eventually. All I wanted from this girl was just a nice conversation.  This almost happened, but out of no where this girl just stopped responding.  
I understand she must‚Äôve had something that kept her busy, so I waited another day before texting back. After 48 hours of no reply, I sent another light hearted text to see if she‚Äôd respond. 

Same thing happened. Nothing

I‚Äôm not sad that she wasn‚Äôt interested, I was just upset that she wasted my time and took my confidence away. She had the audacity to ask for my number, giving me illusion that she seemed interested.  
I‚Äôve been trying to convince myself, it‚Äôs possible to be happy with someone eventually.  Instead, I had a reminder that maybe some people‚Äôs destinies might be predetermined and unchangeable.

At the end of the day. The only person to blame is myself. 
Maybe the hope I had for this person wasn‚Äôt meant to be. I probably got to eager and attached. I just got reminded that life doesn‚Äôt work that way for me. Maybe for other normal people, but not for the people like me.",Had some progress then it was taken away from me,cmourbutts

I am 16 year old boy.
Yes, I know, that sounds too young to judge if I‚Äôm forever alone but please read this text first.
I am chubby. Not fat but chubby.
Also I am medium-ugly.
Doesn‚Äôt sound too bad so far, right?
Okay, let‚Äôs go.
I have asthma.
I have Muscle Hypotonia.
I have Hyperhidrosis.
I have chronic neck pain because my spine is broken. One vertebrae is basically about 1.5 cm further forward than it should be, causing a bump on my neck. It‚Äôs like that since my birth.
I have 14 allergies. Yes, 14. And not rare ones. I have to sneeze all the time.
I have a bad immune system.
Oh, and I also have autism.
Great. So what does this mean?
1. My body is a wreck.
The asthma combined with the Hypotonia is awful. Hypotonia means that my muscles get tired REALLY fast and lose tension.
I really hate sports because I just can‚Äôt get better at anything no matter what I do.
For example: I did 2 hours of endurance sports a week two times a week (for a total of 4 hours a week) for a little over one year.
My endurance hasn‚Äôt improved a single bit. Not at all. Zero.
2. The sweating
I have hyperhidrosis. What does that mean?
Well, it means that I sweat a LOT, mainly in the face, if I do anything. I mean ANYTHING.
I go up the stairs. I sweat.
I walk to the bus station. I sweat.
I walk to the train station at -2*C without a jacket and guess what? I sweat.
And of course I am disgusting for girls when I sweat that much.
3. The autism
The worst part.
I‚Äôm incredibly socially awkward.
And that causes my social anxiety.
My social skills are basically nonexistent.

I like to consider myself unattractive, I‚Äôm fat (and not the good ‚ÄúCarvylicious‚Äù fat but straight up hard to look at fat. My face is ugly to began with but also fat. I have super thin hair and I look like I‚Äôm balding from certain angles. Now that you have a general idea of what I look like, you can imagine why I‚Äôd call myself ugly.

ForeverAlone,"So uh I knew this person in grade 6. We got close and eventually together but it ended mid grade 7. Then we became friends again after a few months and I developed feelings again and told her on new years that year. I got rejected but the way she did so wasn‚Äôt very conclusive cause apparently she still liked me up til the point that I confessed and it turns out my confession gave her the needed closure to move on. My grade 7 brain couldn‚Äôt perceive that and stuck around for a while even after 7th year ended and I moved schools we stayed really close. But then new guy she liked(who happened to be my bestfriend when I was in the other school) came along and jealousy+the pain from being rejected and not fully understanding why broke our weird but close friendship at the time. This was around mid-grade 8. 

By feb in my 8th grade year we kinda made up when I invited her and other friends to a school event. We were never as close but we maintained a good(if distant) friendship and stayed in touch. And I took her to my school ball in 10th grade with permission from my former bestfriend(her boyfriend still at the time, though they had an on-off moment in grade 9). And that was nice. Maybe cause she was the only one I knew to ask or I had lingering feelings I‚Äôm not sure but she was the one I asked.

Grade 11 she moves to the same school as me and with a little inspiration from a friend I had made(who was having a love story of his own) tried to rekindle our close friendship. It worked and we were really close again and I redeveloped feelings I thought I lost. I became a friend she relied on and early on that school year she broke up with my former best friend who I learned was a fucked up lil shit who emotionally mistreated(apparently abused) her and there was even a case of molesting her against her will. Although he apologized and it never happened again it was still pretty shitty and he overall was still shitty. And well maybe she was reeling from all that and went through a string of messy emotional entanglements with three dudes during that year. I was there for her that entire time when she needed me. And eventually at the start of summer after 11th grade a few months after the third guy who she also progressed the farthest with and seemed to genuinely love and care for broke her heart and I was helping her while feeling torn up myself cause I still ultimately had feelings and with prodding from the friend that inspired me to rekindle our friendship I made the incredibly stupid decision to tell her that I still had romantic feelings for her as she was emotionally distressed from the other guy(and all her other personal issues, of which she had a lot) she decided to distance herself from me because well I was added weight and mess to her already wreck of ah emotional state. I noticed and decided to back off also(not completely but we went back to our friendly but distanced relationship we had from feb grade 8-july 11th grade)because I figured it‚Äôs what she wanted.

It‚Äôs now halfway into 12th year and a week ago I started talking to her more closely again. I decided to do that because she‚Äôs important to me and I really didn‚Äôt want to lose her as a close friend even if I know what I really wanted would never come to pass, I figure I could get over that but I know I didn‚Äôt want getting over it to mean she wouldn‚Äôt be in my life anymore. And oddly enough it was my friend(same friend who prodded me into confessing summer after 11th year)breaking up with his girlfriend that inspired me to do that. 

I don‚Äôt really know if this is the right sub for this but I would like to ask am I being stupid? I don‚Äôt know I just sorts realized that I really want her in my life as an important part of it even if we wouldn‚Äôt be romantically close and I wanted to fight to keep that instead of maintaining the torturous distance. I spent the few months since the 11th grade confession desperately trying to forget by drowning myself in other things but idk it never really worked. And since that week I reached out again I‚Äôve started feeling more up about things and life in general. But maybe I‚Äôm just willingly jumping into emotional pain again?

This girl was my first romantic interest and experience. And only one since and she‚Äôs still so important to me and idk I‚Äôll ever experience it again. I mean statistically and logically I understand I will probably but emotionally it just doesn‚Äôt feel that way rn and idk I really really want her in my life still. And I guess I‚Äôm posting in forever alone because I know nothing romantic will ever happen with her again and rn it doesn‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôll ever want that with anyone else nor do I feel like I‚Äôll ever even get the chance to have that with anyone else again so it sort of feels like forever alone but idk if it belongs here",Am I being stupid?,Nordenfang

But me, i never had a girl like open up to me saying she likes me.

Its even worse online cuz if i post a pic of myself, it doesnt get much attention and the internet is honest, so i already know.

Prolly ugly. I know ugly guys can still get girls but the fact no girl is gonna look at me and think

""Wow hes cute""
""Wow hes fine""
""Wow just my type""

I mean i dont care if all girls dont think this way about me, i just want some thinking this way about me, but its never happening

ForeverAlone,"I'm currently on dating sites again, have been on one for coming up on a month now and I keep getting met with the garbage stigma of ""that's how those sites are, what did you expect?"" 

I say I'm looking for someone to fall in love with and get people asking for one night stands. 

I post a picture that shows my full body, appropriately dressed, hair and makeup looking nice, and get vulgar messages either fat-shaming me or asking my bra size. 

I talk about how I'm an artist, a nerd, have a tattoo, and am 420 friendly and get met with people calling me lazy, good-for-nothing, waste of space, or I'm hit on by assholes who fit that description.

Nevermind the fact that I have a college education, a good job that pays my bills with no one else's help, and saying I'm 420 friendly doesn't mean I smoke it but that I don't care if someone does. The most I do is smoke a CBD one-hitter on the weekend, in the comfort of my own home, where I have nowhere to be and nothing to do. Just to chill. 

 I've voiced these concerns and irritations to people before and they always fire back with ""well, what did you expect, you're on dating sites."" The same line goes for if I were to meet someone at a bar, or the gym, or at work.

I get judged for looking in all the wrong places, but I'm not. Those are the right places. They're just full of all the wrong people. 

I'm not saying that people can't find me attractive or that they shouldn't voice if they do, I appreciate the occasional comment of ""You have a beautiful smile"" or ""you have lovely eyes"" but when every comment they make is about all the ""fun things"" they want to do to my body...I just want to hide. I feel ashamed for the body I was born to because it's a magnet for scumbags and that's not ok. 

No one should feel ashamed of who they are or that they're only meant to attract the worst kind of people in the world. It's horrible.

ForeverAlone," 

i   haven't posted here in a few months.  i'd like to think that i had   spent that time seeking relationships and /or sex rather than sulking on   message boards, but that wasn't the case either;   i was busy   overworking (simping and wagecucking, but that's another topic),   purchasing a new car (which i didn't really need) and dealing with other   bullshit such as legal matters (no, i'm not in legal trouble, this was   contract bullshit etc.  That kind of thing).

Another   thing that happened during that time was that i got ""kicked  out""----i'm  using this as a colorful term---- i was really asked to  leave the house  i was living in.   i don't know if i had mentioned it  before, but 3  women also live here and yes, i've shagged them all but  the premise is  that a lot of us are always on thin ice even if we do  ""ascend.""    And  it's not like we were doing it ALL THE TIME----very  infrequently, in  fact it's been over a year since the last ""encounter.""

i   have since re-established contact by texting and i suggested that i   might come back to live there at the house.   She did not say no,   although she did respond with a ""tough"" message to the effect that   people living in her house ""better know how to act."" or something to   that effect.

It has been approximately 7 months since i was asked to leave.

How   should i re-establish contact  to the point where i can return to the   house?   i think it would be too awkward to just show up with clothes,   bedding, toiletries etc.

i was   thinking asking them out to a movie, but, based on past history, the   three can't seem to agree on which movie to see.   That being stated i   only need two of them to go----the home owner and the foid (if i may use   that term) closest to her---because they will  make the final  decision.

2)  Inviting them to  dinner, especially at an all-you-can eat restaurant.    i don't know if  you European and other overseas blokes have this, but  it's basically a  restaurant where you can keep re-filling your plate  until you are  completely full and satisfied vs. being served a plate and  that's the  meal.

Two of the women  would  absolutely LOVE this as they are well, LW's-----let's say ""larger   women.""   The actual homeowner is a ""skeleton,""  and not a big eater,   but she would appreciate the thought.

Any other ideas?

P.S.

Let's please not bombard me with the ""Chad"" comments and flagging the post etc:

This is absolutely not a Chad situation:

1. The house is a ""mental hospital.""

a)  One of the women is a ""karen.""   There is the frequent ""Karen  eruption.""   If i say or do the ""wrong"" thing----then there may be an  immediate verbal barrage-----screaming depending on her mood.  And her  mood isn't excactly stable.....

b)  Another one of the women is a ""mini-karen"" or ""1/4 karen:""   So  not a  true karen, but if the real karen starts screaming, then the mini-karen,  depending on her mood, might feel inclined to join in-----so it's now   Karen nuclear attack!

c) Shit sometimes gets thrown

d) Two of them are LW's  (larger women) and ""Karens""

ForeverAlone,"Say the politicians. Or my personal favorite: ‚ÄúI want our children to grow up in a country where...(insert desired policy)."" 

1) Obviously, these family-oriented messages do not resonate well with me, a 28 year old FA male without any perspective for a family of his own. Come to think of it, the absence of singles - roughly 1/3 of the population in most Western countries - from public debates is quite remarkable. Do you know a public official who is single, excluding divorcees? I can't think of any one. A relationship seems to be a box you just have to tick in order to be taken seriously. Or maybe it's because politicians tend to have strong social skills which are also decisive for relationships. What do you think the reason is? 

2) I've never heard a politician even mention singles as an interest group. Every politician in my country talks about helping families (e.g. by creating new allowances etc.) although sometimes ""families"" may be synonymous with ""people"". It seems so unreasonable from an electoral standpoint. Why devote so much attention and money to a social unit that's dying? I've never heard anyone say ""We shouldn't raise the tax burden on singles."" Do they live in alternate realities?

ForeverAlone,"This happened about 4 years ago.

So there's this girl who is really pretty and charming, she approached me and said she's into me. I was so happy at that time, knowing that there's someone who actually loves me. It feels so heavenly.

But then, i found out myself that she's just lying to me.

How could anyone do this to me? Do you think it's fun messing around with a mentally broken person? Do you fucking think that I'm such a worthless piece of shit, and that's why they made fun of me.

This girl i know is a really good person. Yet, she is treated better than i have ever do. She got loved. She has the priorities that one could have ever wanted. I couldn't understand myself why this girl is treated better than me.

I feel like if i killed myself, no one would remember me and thought that how pathetic and selfish I am to do this. I don't want to die like this, but they forced me to. In a million years, i have never thought that I'm going to do this. Everyone is against me, and i know i had to do it. I am destinied to.

This morning, i woke up from a really bad dream. I got rejected by my crush through text. In that dream, she said that i should kill myself and blocked me right away. Imagine how that feels. Maybe it's a sign i should do it.

 It does make sense in real life tho when she's not interested in me either. Everytime i tried to talk to her, she is busy and ""going to sleep"". She's a liar. She did this so that she won't speak to a pathetic loser. She didn't love me, and I'm tired to pretend that she did. That's the only thing that keeps me alive. I pretended that she's on my side right now, comforting me while I'm crying. What a pathetic stuff to do. I'm such a loser, right?

ForeverAlone,"Hey guys,

This is my first time posting here, and it takes lots of courage. Please forgive me if it annoyed you somehow.

I had always been the most single girl I know and never thought I would get married one day to an amazing guy. Guys I liked were either gay, had girlfriends, or they were not interested in me. The few guys that did approach me to ask me out were either ugly, boring, or players. I went to a speed dating event in summer of 2014 and encountered more awkward and weird men than ever before. They just weren‚Äôt what I was looking for. I ended up talking to other female participants about how terrible the event was and turned it into a career informational interview in the end. My friend introduced me to online dating, so I gave it a try five years ago at the end of 2014.

I went on more dates than I can remember. After seeing enough players, casual daters, and people that were nothing like what they claimed to be, eventually I met this guy that I thought was finally going somewhere. He ended up breaking up my heart. Now that I look back, he was full of red flags screaming at me, trying to show me that he wasn‚Äôt remotely the guy I thought he was. I simply couldn‚Äôt or wouldn‚Äôt see those red flags.

After 41 first dates, I finally met the guy that later became my husband. I went on those 42 first dates during more than two years‚Äô time and learned the better way to go about online dating through trial and error.

If you can relate to my experiences and have some questions about online dating, please feel free to comment below. I will do my best to answer them.

ForeverAlone,"I had decided to give online dating a try over the last few months, and the results went about as well as you might expect. There was one girl that I matched with on that Facebook dating app and was talking with for a few weeks. I made a post here about it already, but in short: I thought I put her off by mentioning I smoke pot, then I came across her Facebook and saw she was already in a relationship so I stopped talking to her. Anyways come early September, I'm still having no luck, and I'm about to do another round of this strict 40 day diet that somewhat limits my ability to socialize so I'm thinking of taking a break from these apps. However, a day or two before my diet I match with a girl on Tinder and decide, what the hell I'll try and talk to her and we'll see how it goes. 

We talk for about a week or so, and seem to be hitting it off. We have a few good conversations, and I even feel comfortable enough to tell her about my diet. I also told her that just because I'm on my diet, it doesn't mean we can't meet up, and I suggest something like getting a coffee and going for a walk or something like that. She says she's up for it, and says she's always in the mood for Starbucks. (Not my favorite, but whatever I'll go there.) We even pick a location that seems to be relatively in the middle of our locations. Ok great, now all we need to do is pick a time. At this point it's Thursday, so I ask if she's free to do it sometime over the weekend, but I acknowledge that since it's somewhat last minute we can do it the following weekend if she's busy. And that's how the conversation ended, I sent that message sometime in the 7 PM hour of Thursday evening, and have yet to get reply. I had sent her another message on Friday updating her of my weekend availability, as some other plans fell into place for me. Still no reply, so I decided to send her one last ditch message last night basically just checking in, saying hope all is well, and asking if she still wants to meet. I'm not expecting her to reply at this point, and I won't send her anymore messages if she doesn't. 

But man I just...I don't get it. Why did she agree to go out with me, agree to an activity, agree on a location, and then just ghost me mid conversation? Based on the conversations we had ,she seemed like she'd be nice enough to at least tell me if she doesn't wanna meet or even talk anymore, even though she said she did wanna meet. I guess it's possible something happened to her or around her that's completely absorbed her time the last few days, but even then how long does it take to send a message?

ForeverAlone,"Hello everyone, I used to post regularly on here and stopped around 2.5 years ago. Wow it‚Äôs crazy it‚Äôs been that fast.

Back then I thought I was going to die alone as in never have a GF and never be my real self to my ‚Äúfriends‚Äù. I only considered 3 people at the time as being my real friends. The rest felt more like friend of friends.

Well it‚Äôs been an emotional rollercoaster. I‚Äôve had my ups and downs and I‚Äôve felt like I‚Äôve hit rock bottom twice since then. I know many of you will tell me to fuck off now that I have a GF but I‚Äôm here to vent.

I‚Äôve discovered a lot of things about myself. I learned I have a disability (possible more) and have a lot of mental issues. I was pretty good as holding it in until a friend attempted to take her life. I could not comprehend why she would do that, I was actually afraid to find the answer. We luckily found her and she‚Äôs doing a lot better but also doesn‚Äôt understand why she did it.

Well I fucked up and think I found the answer. But that same thought process I think she went through also applies to me. It made me question my life and everyone around me. But at the exact same time I fear death. I have so much anxiety just thinking about it. I‚Äôve also lost 2 very close family members in that period and 2 friends. They were not close friends but when we talked we felt comfortable around each other, it‚Äôs hard to explain. 

So all of this made me question myself, my future and my health. I don‚Äôt believe I‚Äôll ever better myself unless I get external help but I don‚Äôt know how to find this help and I‚Äôm too scared to do it. I almost did but of course shit went wrong and I wasn‚Äôt able too. This is exactly how my friend felt. She wanted help but she has no one to go to. She has different personalities for different people in her life.

I‚Äôm the exact same way. I‚Äôm different for my friends vs GF vs family. No one truly knows who I am. When I feel comfortable around people and I try to be myself I turn out to be annoying and hated. So I hide my true self. No one actually cares about me.

I also learned the people I thought were my friends are not my friends. I think only 1 of them might like me for who I am and never will be afraid to accept me. But everyone else does. In high school I was nearly killed in front of my friends by someone I thought was a friend. But I finally learned he was a bully and took advantage of me. He chocked me nearly to death and all my friends just laughed and didn‚Äôt do shit. I cried the entire bus ride home and not a single fucking person asked me if I was okay.

My dad isn‚Äôt in my life. He ‚Äútried‚Äù a could of times but stopped. I then tried to find him and the same thing happened. He stopped trying to contact me. Not even my own fucking father wants me.

Then there‚Äôs my GF. Every since I brought up me having possible mental health issues she‚Äôs been in denial. She refuses to accept they are real and just cannot comprehend what I go through. And she doesn‚Äôt even know all my struggles. She knows what I decided to show her. You guys don‚Äôt even know it either, I have deep shit locked inside and I doubt anyone will ever see it.

She‚Äôs been lately accepting of my ADHD but isn‚Äôt supportive of me continuing to find out if I also have dyslexia. I know for a fact I have a lot of anxiety and stress out a lot but she doesn‚Äôt understand that people besides her can also have it. I do not work in an office like her. I work a simple job where I talk to no one and everyone hates me (customers, not co workers) so it‚Äôs simple stress less job. However I‚Äôm currently unemployed because did the world event. I‚Äôm going to school part time but school gives me so much anxiety and stress but my GF doesn‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs as much stress as she gets from her office job.

What she doesn‚Äôt understand (and what I recently learned) is I‚Äôve never had a positive experience at school.

As a kid my family didn‚Äôt come to events or my awards. My mom didn‚Äôt come to my school field trips. I had social anxiety at school and ADHD (but I didn‚Äôt know that at the time). I was too afraid as a kid to go ask and go to the restroom so I pissed my pants daily. I was blamed for my failures even though I tried my hardest. I was bullied and nearly killed at school. I never had a relationship in school (I met my GF outside school). I was never invited to any social gatherings. I was very fat in school. I had a high pitched voice in school. All my classes were either failure or just barely passed. Some of the teachers at school said I was going no where and I was just going to fail. That fucked me up. In college I lost my financial aid which made me gain a bunch of debt. My 2 car accidents (not my fault thankfully) happened at school. All this stress and anxiety got so bad I wasn‚Äôt able to eat breakfast because if I did, I would just throw it up. I still can‚Äôt eat breakfast even if I don‚Äôt go to school every day. 

I‚Äôve failed so much that I actually have to stay longer in school. Not only that I‚Äôm watching everyone around me get their 4 year degree. I still haven‚Äôt even finished my 2 year degree. And on top of that, because of this virus I‚Äôm going to get delayed another fucking year for my 2 year degree. 

Now what does this have to do with being FA? Exactly what I just said, all those struggles are inside me with no one to speak to them about. No one cares enough to listen, let alone asking what‚Äôs wrong with me. My family doesn‚Äôt give a shut about me. My ‚Äúfriends‚Äù don‚Äôt give a shit about me and just take advantage of me. My own fucking GF doesn‚Äôt want to hear or believe my struggles. I‚Äôm truly internally alone and it fucking sucks. 

I feel like I‚Äôm shouting and everyone can hear me but no one wants to listen. I‚Äôm actively ignored.",I still feel so alone,Account2Discuss
ForeverAlone,"I see many people here are kinda unhappy with themselves. I see posts here like ""why should a girl be with me"" and stuff like that. I don't know if I am narcissist or not but I rarely feel like that. I probably feel the opposite. I have maybe a bit too much pride in myself. Like when I see myself in the mirror after styling my hair with pomade, I tell myself I am still kinda cute even though I am not objectively handsome. Also, I think I am a good person and would make a girl very happy if she accepts to be with me because  I am kind and also supportive and she would feel at home, so to speak, when she is with me.

ForeverAlone,"Since the whole Covid thing started I've been working from home and have a co-worker/friend who I instant message with and she told me that she got engaged.  Now of course I am happy for her.  This was a guy she met through online dating.  She started using online dating less than a year ago and met her fiance within two months.  I would say she is a 6/7 on the looks scale and I remember when she downloaded the app that Friday, she came back the following Monday and told me that she had about 250 messages.  Now if you eliminate perverted messages and other spam I'd say that is probably around 150 legit messages.  I have been using online dating for about 5 years now off and on and she once told me she doesn't understand how I can't meet anyone.  I didn't bother explaining to her that generally men and women have vastly different experiences.  I wish her well and I'm happy for her but she gave me a close up view of how online dating is.  

I'll be 40 in a few weeks and I honestly thought I would have a better chance now since I pretty much only message women in their late 30s to early to mid 40s.  I guess they still get a lot of messages.  I am average at best when it comes to looks and so far the best I've done is going on two dates with the same women.  

One way I have streamlined things is to understand the reality.  Of the women who respond to my messages, the ones who I actually will exchange numbers with/meet are 5% or less.  Also if I see that a woman is sending short responses or isn't making an effort to try to get to know me or ask questions I just stop communication.  I understand that women generally get more messages so I get why the vast majority never respond but I'll never understand why some seem to respond but make zero effort to get to know you.  I guess there really are women who use online dating as some sort of an ego boost.

I honestly think all of us on here can meet someone but we are in what someone once described to me as the ""borderline zone"".  So a woman may be willing to meet up with us for coffee but we have to be absolutely perfect and say all the right things because the least little thing could turn her off.  I've had two friends in my life that would be considered ""chads"" and seeing them talk to women showed me how looks can go a long way with initial conversations.  I had a friend who would say the silliest or goofiest things or would be up front and say that he lived with his parents and was unemployed (he was in his late 20s) and they still pursued a relationship with him.  

Lastly, one major thing I learned with online dating is that if I can get to the point of a meetup just do coffee.  The first three times I met up with a woman I met up for lunch and I paid, only to get the ""you are a great guy but"" text 30 minutes after the meal so now I just do coffee at first.  I also learned that if they agree to meet you and then cancel without offering a different date, then don't bother.  Like I said before, once I realized just how much attention women generally get (generally because there are female FAs) I stopped getting being frustrated.  If things were reversed I would be very selective.  Although I do remember someone saying that having lots of options can make you a bit of a jerk but I don't know if that is true.  

I'm really happy for my co-worker, and honestly she really illustrated to me without realizing the massive numbers game that is online dating.",Online Dating Strikes Again,larosha1

4. I still pinch myself that I‚Äôm no longer a virgin. It has been a long time coming (literally). Mentally I wasn‚Äôt sure when it was ever going to happen for me. 

But here are the things that for me aren‚Äôt amazing or didn‚Äôt change. 

1. All of a sudden you have to worry about someone else, because that‚Äôs expected. Due to necessity, I‚Äôve always been an independent guy. I worry about myself and don‚Äôt expect others to worry about me. It‚Äôs different now and can be less preferable depending on your personality. 
2. Your gf can get mad at you cause you did something and it can get frustrating. Also you might start getting jealous and/or mad at her yourself. 
3. I have other goals in life (fitness, professional, etc) and she doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúhelp‚Äù me in any of those. If I am still a stagnant professionally, having a gf does nothing. 
4. It‚Äôs expensive. You go out more now and have to pay for those experiences. 

So at the end of the day, I am glad that I have a gf, but I would not say that my life has dramatically improved because she‚Äôs there. Again perhaps this gf is not ‚Äúthe one‚Äù but the way I see it, if your life is a 3/10, getting a girlfriend might improve it to 5/10, but you won‚Äôt shoot up to 7/10 or 8/10.",My review of ‚Äúescaping‚Äù FA,dba415

ForeverAlone,"My first post asking for someone to be my friend.



I have seen others ask for friends and I did PM a few but they either reply 40+ hours later for every single message or stop replying, I take it im boring or something. Dont get me wrong I understand people are busy and I dont expect anyone to be glued to their phone or PC but at least some minimum communication would be appreciated or just tell me youre busy I guess. Ok, ill stop complaining.


Anyway what I can offer I suppose:

I play Path of exile almost exclusively, although am open to other games except battle royale stuff or card games like heartstone so we could play togheter if youd like.

Or we could watch movies/tv shows and even animes togheter, I absolutely dont mind hearing you vent or let your anger and frustrations out  tho` dont expect me to offer advice because I probably dont have any and am bad at comforting since I never did it, but I will try! We could also listen to music I am open to suggestions as well. Or we could share what happened throughout our day, random thoughts we might have, ideas, memes or anything else you want.


I also am complete trash at conversing but again I will try my best and lastly I am open to voice calls but it goes without saying I will be awkward at first and probably talk very little. 


I almost forgot the most important part: I am a man, mid 20s. I will also mention I have never had a friend so I dont know what to expect. I just do things... and think about it later.

ForeverAlone,"Your life is in the periphery, at the very fringe of the society if you...

\- are ugly/unattractive

\- have poor health/little energy to be active

\- work a simple job, and not a prestigious well-earning one

\- are poor or live an ascetic life

\- have very few people if any caring about you

To bring an illustration of a city... Periphery is if you live in a broken old tiny house at the very outskirts of the city. You are ugly, poor, alone, frail with medical conditions. Being in city center in a fancy big building is like if you are a handsome rich successful businessman, or a famous athlete/actor/musician, and all women are vying for your attention.

The eyes of people are all gravitated towards the center. They look away from periphery, and face the glamour that is in the center, dreaming to be part of it. It would take a very curious adventurous traveller to go completely against mainstream, to take an interest in what is happening in the periphery. Someone, whose mindset and mentality is completely at the fringe of the society as well, and who has got bored of the party in the center. Someone, who is pushing against the wave of people to get out of a big concert, while the rest of the people are pushing to get inside through the gates.

Then this traveller would go on a long exhausting journey, to the very outskirts of the city. Where there is nothing but silence.

ForeverAlone,"No, I didn't get a girlfriend so don't break out the champagne.
I accomplished something more within my purview: I managed to run the equivalent of a half-marathon this morning! Usually during the week I'll just keep it to a minimum of around 5K or more just to make sure I get *some* cardio in every day in addition to my weightlifting. 

The weekends are usually my times when I do my long runs, usually right when I get up around 3:30 or 4 am which I love because there's no one out; no cars, no people and it's nice and dark out and can run all over the street.  So I'd usually max out around 7 or 8 miles but this morning I said ""Fuck it..."" and just. kept. running. Two times I felt like throwing up and crapping my pants at the same time but I pushed through.

When I got back to the apartment and limped up the steps and checked my distance I did a tad more than 13.1 miles. That's the most I've ever run in one sitting in my life and I'm pretty damn proud of myself.

ForeverAlone,"Don't you feel like it is so strange that you are not liked by girls? I mean I do, I don't see what's wrong with me. I have not bad looks ( I would say average), I don't have a Bad personalty, I am very talkative and outgoing. I can provide good conversation, I can talk about dense subjects like literature, politics, cinema, philoshopy, about life itself,about feelings, whatever. Moreover, I can as well provide casual conversation and just have fun and talk about simple things and laugh and all that. 

What's more I am not shy, I have no problem appraching girls and talking to them. But what just happens is that no girl likes me, how can that be possible? I mean, there's plenty of guys out there with average looks that are not intelligent at all and can't even provide good conversation and they get laid a lot. 

Plenty of guys out there with no studies, with no ambitions, with no hobbies that make them interesting are getting laid with hot girls. Can be possible that women prefer simple and shallow guys? And then they tell you that If you don't get girls is cause you have to work on yourself, that you have nothing to offer, for god's sake, isn't it amazing? 

I don't pretend to sound arrogant, but damn it , I know myself and I value my own worth, and I know I am and interesting guy, and I have so much love to offer, If I had a girlfriend I would be the perfect lover, I would give everything I have to make her happy, I could even write her poems and songs, and take care of her, but maybe that is my problem, that I am a sensitive guy, and let me inform you, women don't like sensitive guys unless they are very handosome or famous artists like singers or actors.

ForeverAlone,"When I think back on my life up to now I realize it has been marked by cyclic behavior. There‚Äôs never been a grand overarching strategy, no path, no purpose or anything of the kind. 

The only constants are my FAdom (no romantic experience ever!) and frequent quitting. Here‚Äôs how it goes: 

1) Take a long hard look at my life and realize how uneventful, lonely and empty it is. Panic. Shudder at the idea of having to live this way for many many decades. (‚ÄúSomething HAS GOT to change. Now!‚Äù I scream at myself)

2) Start several new hobbies, go to meetup groups regularly for several months up to 2 years, struggle at making any non-superficial connection

3. Realize how little progress I made in the social sphere. Still no friends. People barely remember my name in the hobby groups. I know quite a bit about them but they can‚Äôt remember a thing about me (I‚Äôd be the best secret service agent based on how forgettable my appearance and behavior are).

ForeverAlone,"Alright so. I‚Äôm gonna get this out of the way. I‚Äôm actually like. Batshit. Completely insane as a person I‚Äôm pretty sure.

Not really going to go into details. But to sum it up. My mind on a daily basis feels like a fractured mirror, I have horribly vivid nightmares all the time, and I can‚Äôt make real good sense of anything. 

So anyways. Do you ever feel like the reason why your life sucks so much dick is because you actually have no control over anything? Like I mean. I used to have dreams, I used to feel like I had some form of influence on everything that was going MY WAY. Like I had the power to do anything and everyone used to really like me and I knew how to be a person people really like.

But like nowadays. Years since that time of my life has passed. I‚Äôve begun to believe I have absolutely no control over EVERYTHING. From my thoughts, my actions, my feelings, my direction in life, what I believe, and where I am going, and who will like me as a person.

I keep trying to change. I keep trying to make sense of how I can get where I need to go. And I‚Äôm not really sure why it never makes sense. Why I feel so insane as a person. And why I never seem to have the capability to pursue my goals.

I actually think this is a metaphysical and psychological and ontological issue. Something that everyone has even myself. But no one is aware of it.

Psychological hard determinism is what I think it‚Äôs called, or fatalism. as if it was my fucking fate to me miserable, to be lonely, to be insane and never go anywhere exciting, or important with my life.

I believe that some people are just born a certain way to where they can succeed. And I‚Äôm talking like what‚Äôs within themselves, the chemicals in their brain, their intelligence, their heart, soul, ambitions, and dreams.

I don‚Äôt have dreams anymore. Idk what happened to me, at some point I went insane.

Now I could go into details on how I actually went insane. But I‚Äôd rather not and actually tackle my main motherfucking issue right now.

Is the reason why I am this way now. Simply because I was fated to be this way. I was doomed to fail. Is the reason why we are all this way, is because of fate?

As if there is some kind of driving force in human beings that compels them to do the things they do. Something completely out of their control. Like they are mere puppets on strings.

I feel like. Sometimes I feel like there is some kind of unknown force driving my behaviors and thoughts. I‚Äôm not even kidding. Something that compels me to do what I do but it‚Äôs never anything that could really get me anywhere fantastic or anything.

Is free will even real?

I even ask myself. Does god actually exist? But god is like some type of psychotic psychopathic puppet master? That actually created this world and drove us to become what we became today?

I‚Äôve had dreams. About this very thought. That the universe and the fundamental truths to reality, are actually really deep, dark, and mysterious. And there is this unknown evil and horrendously dispiriting truth to the reality of everything.

My life is a complete nightmare. It hurts so much sometimes I‚Äôm not even joking.

I have no idea what to do about any of this believe me I‚Äôve talked to psychiatrists, therapists, and even my own parents about my issues. They all offer me advice. But the problem with this picture is that they PUT THE POWER IN MY HANDS TO MAKE CHANGES. and I‚Äôm not shitting you I feel like I cannot, possibly, make any sort of appropriate or positive change to my life because fate has decided otherwise.

ForeverAlone,"Previously, as embarrassing as it is to say even as an FA like myself, the best day of my life would be to finally breakthrough and kiss a girl for the first time. I am not saying that was my absolute scenario for the best day ever but something of that nature, as I am a KHHV. It could be something as normal as going on a date and it turning out successful, or just having a fun, flirtatious conversation with a girl and you manage to convince her that she likes you enough to get her number. Obviously, sex is cool and all but just to experience the more common things that normies get to would be a dream and enough for me.

Now, I will say the best thing that could happen to me is when it doesn't affect me anymore. It has got that low. If I were to tell you the truth, I have been severely depressed since late last year and it has not gotten better. I am surprised how good I am at masking it, because it saves me from having to explain myself to people who would not understand.

I long for the day that I when I look at a woman and I feel or think of nothing. I give up. Yes, I give up without even trying and that's possible. Let me explain. There is giving up when you have made an effort at something and it still does not work out for you, we all know that. There is also 'giving up' when you have not made an attempt yet or at all because essentially you are forfeiting the option to even try at all and that is where I am currently at. I believe I am too far gone, not really in age but in my social incapabilities and mental health to even find the hope that is needed to try to reverse a situation like mine.

I want to share these guys since I feel that one of the fundamental keys of success is to surround yourself with those who are already more successful than you are at whatever goal you have. For instance, if you want to be a fashion guru, surround yourself with different fashion mentors who can help you along the way. I recommend you have multiple mentors as opposed to mentor. Soon hanging out with multiple mentors and like-minded friends will lift your level, and you will find yourself doing extraordinary things.

ForeverAlone,"I honestly don‚Äôt know if I even really mind the idea of being FA all of my life. I am currently 20 so I still have some time to grow and mature, but I have started to become pretty happy with my circumstances.

I lost pretty much all of my friends in freshman year of highschool and was never able to fully recover. I was able to make more friends who I value so much, but I purposely drift away from them.

For example, one of my closest friends of my entire life just had their 21st birthday party. We had met when I first moved to the neighborhood we grew up in as little kids. We were friends for so long, but freshman year of highschool we started really drifting apart and I forgot how to talk to him. He didn‚Äôt invite me to his party, and I‚Äôm glad because I just see it as a good excuse to never talk to him again.

I hate how there are still a few people from highschool who try to talk to me and see what‚Äôs up. I am really appreciative that they still seem to care about me a little bit, but I am so different from when I was in highschool. I know that every interaction I will ever have will be a disappointment for them. Thankfully the virus has caused me to drift from everyone even further. I have basically alienated the few people who still liked me,  but it was inevitable anyways since I suck pretty badly.

But when I look at being alone, I honestly enjoy it. Relationships are overrated for sure, I don‚Äôt want to have to deal with some female making my life miserable and taking away my freedom, parties make me so uncomfortable, just sitting alone playing xbox while stoned is much better for me.

I never stood a chance in this life. This is ridiculous. What is everyday life? Just a struggle. Dragging your corpse around. You never get going, because heavy (physical) struggles weigh you down, while others live like nothing is hindering them.

And about being alone. This is not merely about dating. It's about everything. Truly Alone. Me *versus* the entire human race. The brains of other people work completely differently to mine. I can hardly be among humans any more. It's unbearable.

My biggest gripe? Humans just can't be truly honest. I mean brutally honest. I feel like I have been lied to my entire life. The entire society is a lie. Humans say one thing, then do another. What kind of \*\*\* primate brain is this? Unimaginable for me.

All human-induced problems in the world come from dishonesty. But it's pointless to even try to explain this to humans. They will never understand it. And keep living like everything is fine. F\*\*\* hell. What kind of planet do I live on?

So, women, they see that, but they can't give up that relationship? Sure, because they are 'in love' with that men, how the fuck they fall in love with them? 

It seems that women find some attractive men and they have enough to fall in love, not considering for 1 minute if they will treat them well. So that's the thing, it's as if women think  ""he's been a little bit toxic, but I find him so hot I can't let him go, I love him"" and then women go on to bear all kinds of abuse because they love them and they think they can transform that Bad men into good guys.

I mean, seeing that totally pierces my heart, I will treat women super well but they just give me the cold shoulder and that fucking bad guys that abuse them in all ways are getting laid. Isn't this society insane?

 It's become clear to me that women prefer a Bad/toxic relationship with an attractive man that a heatlhy relationship with an average/non-attractive man. But, they, women, will say all kinds of bullshit against toxic relationships just to end up in one, because in theory, they are prefer the sensitive guy that will treat them well, but in practice it is so different. 

Maybe they can't help it and it's all due to their biology, who knows? It just seems so unfair that so many abusers are in relatinships and plenty of nice guys are just sentenced to be lonely forever. I have always thought I had so much to offer to a girl, that I would give everything if I ever was in a relationship, and thinking that mean guys can get plenty of what I cant even get a crumb fills my heart with despair.

ForeverAlone,"1. Usually when a guy makes a rant about women and his bad experiences he's had with them you'll usually see responses like ""ummm maybe you just attract shitty women"", ""don't generalize women as a whole just because the women YOU went for are skanks"". Try telling a venting woman that just went through a bad experience with a guy that she ""just picks bad men"" and you'll get hit with a dandy niceguysTM label on sight, along with other defensive responses about how she can go for whoever tf she wants etc etc. I also find it funny how some of the same females that preach against generalizations cry ""men ain't shit"" ""men are pigs"" as soon as they're shit goes south with a dude. 

I even called this one girl I knew from hs out on it on her story and tried to break it down to her that not all guys are these diabolical supervillains she's portraying them to be and she repsonded back ""that's not the point"" üòÇ and the funny thing is she's very much against these types of generalizations being made against women. Tou-fucking-che lol.

2. ""Body shaming"". Now yes body shaming is a shitty thing to do to a person just because they may not be your romantic preference. So with this in mind you'd think the same crowd making all these movements against weight, tit, ass shaming wouldn't stoop to said level and body shame a man's, height, penis size, build, looks, etc right....? Oh wait but see that's just ""preference"" lmao nuff said.

3. ""Entitlement"", this is a juicy one indeed. I've seen this term thrown around by both men and women, but still primarily aimed at guys in this context. It don't matter how justified or bullshittingly this word is used, no sir, this word gets thrown around almost as much as fucking ""simp"" (though that's a rant for another time). I'll see some females throw tantrums because their mans didn't max out their bank account for them and give them their dream car (or that they got them the wrong model lmao), rings, purses, etc but will be just as quick to call men entitled for wanting something less materialistic, love. Fair enough though no one is entitled to anything. You're not obligated to give up pune or your love to a guy and I think that's a very fair system. However, at the same time a man isn't obligated to give you anything materialistic just because it's the ""gentleman thing to do"", no ma'am the shit goes both ways.

ForeverAlone,"There's a technique in psychology called ""Memory implantation"".

It's simple: nobody has a perfectly ""photographic"" memory, meaning that no human being in the world remembers events and locations in the exact way they happened. That is why people often get surprised when someone goes ""You should have been there, it was a great party!"" and the other guy goes ""Dude I WAS there!"" and it turns out the guy is in the pictures, the other dude just didn't remember.

Same for situations like ""When I was 5 years old I got a cat for my birthday"" and a parent goes ""It was a dog. You got the cat when you were 10"" and the person then realises ""Wait, was it?""

Sooooo... memory implantation is the system in which you convince someone of events that never actually happened, but their mind is unable to tell they're not real. Their brain just accepts it as part of the past. It works by **repetition**, repeating the same lie over and over until the mind accepts it, and, **most importantly, verisimilitude**, meaning the lies have to be believable, reasonable to a certain degree, nothing too insane to be accepted.

And I thought ""I wish someone would do that to me and convince me of a happy past that never actually took place"". I would absolutely accept it. Just lie to me and convince me of stuff that I didn't actually do.

But what about the records? There would be no pictures and no documents proving these events. Well, let's find more people like me.

Find a group of foreveraloners, go to the places you supposedly went to, take pictures, and then get convinced that you took those photos years ago. Suddenly, you have had a group of friends for years, and you even went on vacations together!

Back when I was a teenager I would often read romance stories on websites like Fanfiction and whatnot, and often times when there was a romantic scene I would often imagine myself as the girl in that situation rather than the guy.  Throughout high school I was never really the ""manly-man"" type as it made me really uncomfortable; often times I'd have more girl friends than guy friends.  I've never really put much thought into these interactions as they seemed almost instinctual at the time, and it wasn't until later that I realized that I was a bit different from other guys.  

For my most recent escapade, about a two years ago I decided to go on Grindr.  I was curious to know what sex was like and was too frightened to date other women at the time, so I tried this dating app.  I eventually ended up hooking up with a man who was a touch older than me.  I was real nervous and just kinda winged it.  I didn't ""finish"" and I felt really embarrassed but he was nice about it and it ended on a good note.

ForeverAlone,"I find that, the longer I stay alone, and the more times I have to face the dread that is born of inescapable loneliness, the more I come to appreciate tragic things: Loss of control, ignorance of one's shortcomings, desolation against overwhelming odds, etc.

I believe there is hope to be found in this development; Anyone would occasionally enjoy a tragedy once in a while. It is why they exist. We seem to crave despair, sometimes. But I think I have found the reason why.

I have come to be attracted to tragedy more as my own life, perhaps, seems more tragic. Secondly, I believe that all learned behaviors are to better facilitate one's survival in the current environment. Thirdly and finally, since people ""enjoy"" tragedy, the sadness it creates cannot be wholly unwholesome; it is not wholly revolting like the disgust when viewing gruesome imagery, it is not wholly undesirable like boredom. 

Therefore, I have concluded that the mind naturally finds enjoyment in tragedy so that it may not lose hope when everything goes wrong.

ForeverAlone,"I went out with a few friends the other night, and we took a few dreaded group photos. I try to avoid photos of myself because it really brings me back to reality about how ugly I actually am. 

I‚Äôm female, and I went out with 5 other girls. Three of them are average looking and two of them are absolutely stunning. And then there‚Äôs me. I‚Äôm well below average, and I look like a monster next to them in these photos.

It‚Äôs not that I‚Äôm overweight, because 4 of these girls are bigger than me. I‚Äôm average weight but I carry my weight horribly - I‚Äôm apple / round shaped while the rest of them have feminine curves. My face also looks like it belongs to a 50 year old woman instead of my 22 year old self. It‚Äôs just not nice and supple like most women my age, it‚Äôs gaunt and droopy and full of lines and texture. My facial features are also really odd. They just don‚Äôt go well together at all. Don‚Äôt get me started on my thinning hair lol. 

It‚Äôs just weird. I see so many women my age and practically all of them just look better than me. I know ‚Äúyou‚Äôre your own worst enemy‚Äù but I just don‚Äôt look right. My body is extremely unfeminine and odd looking, and my face is just off. I wish I could just look average and womanly. I don‚Äôt need to be supermodel perfect but just being a woman who looks like a woman would be fantastic. 

And then my personality is shit on top of it. I was home schooled and I‚Äôm totally socially stunted because of it. I‚Äôm super awkward and people tend to distance themselves from me. The girls I went out with aren‚Äôt really my friends, one of them is and the rest are her friends. Pretty sure she always invites me out of pity.

i know i need to stop comparing my self to others bc everyones lifes are different and everyone is unique but i dont think im unique.

i was lazy and stuck at home but i got tired of my gut and got a job and got a few hobbies but i still dont have friends.

i would talk online with girls to prove im good at convos when they would ignore me i would think im not good enough and began to hate my self.

its like i reflect my self worth on how they react to me. when i have nothing to say or they say nothing to me,i call my self worthless.

ForeverAlone,"There are plenty of reasons why I'm on this sub, but I've never really made a comprehensive list of them. I've had these thoughts bouncing around in my head for a very long time now, so I decided I'd write a brief (lol, 'brief') overview of all the main ones.  
Disclaimer by the way, I fully recognise that the overwhelming majority of the things I've listed are my own fault. I am the problem here, and I blame no one but myself for the position I find myself in.

Firstly, I'm physically repulsive. Don't get me wrong, my personal hygiene is perfectly fine - I shower, and brush my teeth, and exercise - but I've still somehow managed to make a real mess of my body. I have bad dandruff. My face is pockmarked with acne scars from when I was younger. My teeth are crooked and yellowed, I have horrible breath. I'm fat, but not in the conventional sense - I believe 'skinny fat' is the term, which in effect means that I have a healthy BMI and weight for my height, however I still have a hideous beer gut despite never having touched a drop of alcohol in my life. I'm unfortunately hairy, well beyond the point of it being 'just' gross. My nails, both toe &amp; finger, are an unsightly mess, and my feet in particular are grotesque (I'll spare you the details).

My personality is irredeemable. I'm astonishingly boring. I don't have any goals, aspirations, or dreams. I have no hobbies, no passions, no interests, nothing that I particularly enjoy. My free time is spent mindlessly scrolling through reddit, watching the same single twitch streamer/youtuber I've been watching for the past 6 years, and copious amounts of lying in bed staring at my ceiling/wall while I listen to my spotify playlist on shuffle. It's been years and nothing has changed. I'd say that I'm a recluse, but I'm not sure that recluse is a pejorative enough word.

Of course it's not just that I'm bland and mundane. I have just enough self awareness to recognise that I'm not exactly the most pleasant person to be around either. I'll put myself down at every opportunity, for what I believe are truly valid and well-founded reasons (I mean cmon, are you reading this post?). I'm overly pessimistic, negative and defeatist. I apologise constantly, for everything. I'm a disgustingly toxic person, and I can only imagine how draining and exhausting it must be to be around me for any length of time.

It follows naturally that socially, I'm an abject failure. My social skills are on par with a vegetable's, and that's not an exaggeration as much as I would love for it to be. I don't know why (well I can hazard a guess), but I just don't know how to speak or act or *be* like a normal person. Everything I do feels like a poor emulation of how everyone else does it. Without fail, I manage to alienate almost everyone I speak with simply by opening my mouth.

I suppose it also bears mentioning that I'm fairly sure I'm not all there mentally speaking. I've never been to a therapist or a psychologist before, but I wouldn't be at all shocked to learn that there's something wrong upstairs. Maybe depression or anxiety, potentially some degree of autism, or if not then perhaps something like AvPD. Not a huge fan of self diagnosis though, I'll admit.

TL;DR, I'm a miserable, pathetic and toxic person that has no redeeming qualities to speak of.

I wish that I were different. I wish things had turned out differently. I'd love nothing more than to go out and have fun with friends, have a successful career, marry one day, start a family. I'm thoroughly undeserving of any of that. Wishes mean nothing in the face of unfortunate reality, and I'm clearly too lazy and unmotivated to do anything about it.

I would have loved to cuddle and hug them all the time and I would've done my best to make them happy. I would've sent them good morning texts every day, and cheered them up whenever they were sad. When it was that time of the month I'd buy her chocolate and tampons and pick her favorite movies to cuddle and watch together. I'd buy her gifts at random times to surprise her and see her smile. I'd set her as my phone and desktop background so I could see her face whenever I wanted. I'd tell her all the time ho much I care about her and appreciate her. I'd thank her for all the little things she does for me too. We'd laugh together, cry together, sleep together, eat together. I'd massage her feet when she was tired, I'd sing love songs to her to make her smile. I'd brag to my friends about how amazing my girlfriend is while she's right next to me to embarrass her. I'd strive every year to make her fall more in love with me. I'd just do everything in my power to make her happy.

That's just one of several issues that makes it so hard to find someone.

This is what I hate, it's one thing I have never had a girlfriend, but short of that I have very little experience anyway.

ForeverAlone,"Being raised in the rural south, and in a ""Southern Baptist"" household, I was taught to respect my parents. For so many years, I did so much to earn my father's love. I wish I knew now how impossible that was... Did it matter to me then that I have a deformed pinky finger from having it busted by a big, redneck belt buckle when I was 5? No, that was my fault for not eating my veggies. He didn't mean to hurt me. (Don't you wish there was a sarcasm font?) 

&amp;#x200B;

I busted my hump in church youth activities, Marching band, Scouts... It meant nothing to him that I've met several presidents, shaken hands with them, gotten a handwritten letter and a gift from Nancy Reagan because of a letter I wrote ""Ronnie"" in 3rd grade. 

&amp;#x200B;

When I got my Eagle Scout, I stood there with the other boys, hearing their fathers brag on them. I got ""About damn time.. It cost me enough money"" from my dad. 

&amp;#x200B;

My mother was disabled and couldn't drive. So, she worked out of the home, and part-time at a family-owned store. When Dad's back went out and he had to have emergency surgery, I gave up my scholarship to college, came home, got a job and gave them the bulk of my paycheck. And what thanks did I get? He told people that I came home like a sorry dog with my tail between my legs. 

&amp;#x200B;

Later, he told me there was a reason there was 10 years between my older sister and I... He never wanted another child. He was happy with just her. He looked me in the eyes and said the only reason I was born was because he didn't want to go to hell for forcing my mother to have an abortion. 

&amp;#x200B;

I married and moved on. In December of 2004, I was critically injured in an accident. I was a pedestrian hit by an out of control truck, driven by a minor, in a parking lot... I was launched through the air, into a brick wall and died. I had to be revived. That was a Friday night.. my first memories are from Monday. You ever wake up from a hangover and wonder what the hell happened the night before... Try having 3 days of your life gone and no memory of what happened to you. All I know is what I've been told happened. Surgeries, therapies, PTSD, brain damage (In the language center, I often speak in word salad when I'm stressed or tired), I walk with a cane, I live in chronic pain, and I gained a lot of weight. 

&amp;#x200B;

In 2007, my (now ex) wife admitted she had been cheating and left me. At one point, she told me she had to be drunk to want to have sex with me. 

&amp;#x200B;

My mother's health started failing. She had multiple heart attacks and at least one stroke. And, while I was making it just fine on my own, at my father's request, I moved home to care for her because he couldn't (He couldn't be bothered to learn about nutrition, and caring for someone with severe (BRUTAL) diabetes). When I moved in, her A1C was over 14 and they were having to call the paramedics every couple of weeks to revive her because her sugar would crash. Within a year, I had her A1C down to about 8... and by the 18-month mark, I had her under 7 again! Dad didn't charge me rent. But, I paid all their utilities, paid for a chunk of their groceries (and bought my own), did their meal planning, managed mom's health, paid for their Rx's when they were in the ""Doughnut Hole"".... And, the whole time, my father had been telling people I had begged to move back home and was mooching off him. 

&amp;#x200B;

During this time, I had met someone, gotten engaged... after 6 years, I turned Mom's health care over to my sister and moved back out because I couldn't take my father's violent nature any more (Christmas of 2014, he threw a box of stuff at me while I was trying to help him!). 

&amp;#x200B;

I got my own place again and was trying to make a home for my new fianc√©e... Then, even she gave up on me. Just gave up. Stopped calling, then stopped texting‚Ä¶  

&amp;#x200B;

My sister found a way to screw me out of the 2 acres of land my grandmother had left me. Then, she got power of attorney over my parents and wrote me out of their wills. 

&amp;#x200B;

Mom had another stroke and they managed to convince her I had been stealing from them those years I cared for her. I was banned from coming back on their property and My number got blocked. I haven't seen or spoken to my mother since early 2015. In late October 2018, I found out from a friend that knows the family, she passed away and no one, not a damn person in my family even bothered to tell me. I didn't find out until after her funeral. 

&amp;#x200B;

I sit here writing this, alone. I've tried dating, and I'm tired of getting constantly ghosted on. Or, getting cheated on when they don't ghost.  Usually, it's because of my injuries and/or weight. 

&amp;#x200B;

I struggle every day to just go through the motions of work and come home to an empty home. The chronic pains from the accident are getting worse. The nerve damage is progressing. I found out I might even lose my leg. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not looking for sympathy. I just wanted to get my story out there and vent. I have no one I can really talk to.  The few friends I have just keep telling me to ""Get over it"" or that I'm ""Living in the past"" - it's not like I can filp a switch and forget about it when every move I make, some part of my body hurts from the accident, and that just triggers my mind to go down the spiral of negative memories.",Unwanted....,wolfmanrobby

ForeverAlone,"My circumstance is quite unique. I can't really meet people where I am as it's quite isolated. Nobody really knows that I exist, so I don't really know if anybody would be romantically attracted to me or would like to be my friend.

It just really sucks that I have nobody to talk to about this. Even if I found someone to meet, I'd find it difficult to summon up the courage to actually meet them in person and do things with them.

I guess I just wanted to complain and whine about my situation. I can't even tell if I'm attractive to people and I don't know if people would like me. I run little simulations in my head to figure things out and I come up blank every time.

I've honestly tried my best to make friends online and it almost always fizzles out. My guess is that if we don't have things to do together like play a video game together or go to an event together, it can grow stale really quickly. That's why the online friends I have in video games, I can get along with far better.

But honestly, what would I give to meet a dorky and nerdy girl that's just genuine and honest? Seriously. I don't even know what dating is like or what holding hands is like. I'd be over the moon if I ever got to experience that but reality is disappointing, apparently.

I've worked hard to reinvent myself. To change the way I think and see myself. To participate in different hobbies. To try and say ""yes"" to unexpected or unplanned requests/events. So, I know that I'm a different person than I was a few years ago and I'm quite happy with this new version of myself.

It's just that I fear that I'm slowly wasting my youth away being alone. Oh well. Sometimes I feel like I don't even have the right to want to date a girl because I think that I'm a reprehensible being. It's crazy what isolation can do to you, isn't it?

I feel like I give too much and never receive anything back. It's just disappointing. 

I don't think I've ever felt truly wanted or needed by a friend or a lover, at least not when I'm being genuine. Whatever I do it just never feels like it's enough. I just feel like giving up again, 'cause what's the point anyway? 

I thought I was a pretty good looking guy but apparently that doesn't matter so much as other people like to think.

My point is, it seems as if society immediately seems to suggest it's a fault with the person and that they must be evil or have serious problems to not reach these ""milestones"".

ForeverAlone,"Hi everyone, I posted this elsewhere but deleted, I‚Äôve just found this forum so I hope I‚Äôm now posting in the right place. I just feel like I need somewhere to rant because I can‚Äôt talk about this to anyone in real life, I can‚Äôt imagine what they‚Äôd think.

So whilst I‚Äôm only in my early 20s, I‚Äôve never had any male attention at all, never done anything with a man, I feel so ugly and worthless, I have ocd and probably other issues, I can‚Äôt imagine myself in a relationship because I struggle to find anything to talk about to anyone 95% of the time, I only have one friend and I haven‚Äôt even seen her in over a year. 

Last year I finally got my dream job that i‚Äôd been working towards for about 3 years. And there‚Äôs an older man there who I‚Äôve fallen in love with. He‚Äôs never given me a second thought, but I‚Äôm so attracted to him and I think about him all the time. Literally 24/7. 

He‚Äôs married with 3 children, who are so close in age that him and his wife must be extremely fertile. All I can imagine is how easy it must have been for them even though I know how unreasonable this sounds, I don‚Äôt know what they may have been through, but they met and got married within a year, first child arrived soon after so everything moved very fast in their relationship and it seems they‚Äôre so lucky. 

Fertility is something that‚Äôs making me so depressed recently, I had some irregular periods although it‚Äôs better now, and I think I‚Äôm fairly healthy. But because my life has barely had anything good happen, I‚Äôm convinced that I‚Äôll struggle to conceive if I‚Äôm ever lucky enough to have the opportunity- If i never get a relationship, I‚Äôve considered using a donor or an app where you can find someone to have a child with. I literally worry 24/7 now that I‚Äôll have problems conceiving, or that if I‚Äôm ever lucky enough to eventually get pregnant, something will go wrong and I‚Äôll never have a healthy baby. 

These feelings combined with the thoughts of the man I‚Äòm in love with and how easy him and his wife had it to have children, make me so depressed now. The only thing that comforts me a tiny bit is the fact he was in his 40s when they met and got married, so he‚Äôs an older dad and maybe he struggled with having children with previous partners. But then I remember again how quickly him and his wife conceived so any comforting thoughts soon fade. It doesn‚Äôt help that he talks about his kids all the time. 

I‚Äôm going back into my office soon after months away because of the pandemic and the thought of seeing him has kept me going through these last few horrible lonely months. And I keep telling myself that he‚Äôs not even ever given me a second thought. Probably thinks of me as this sad, ugly, lonely stupid young girl. And now although this is my dream job, I think the best thing for my mental health and for any chance of moving on is to leave. Which breaks my heart but I think it‚Äôs my only choice.

P.s - I know I‚Äôm probably not ‚Äúin love‚Äù with him the real way, but I don‚Äôt know what love really is so this is the only way I can describe it. 

Thank you for reading, I‚Äôm sorry I just needed to rant somewhere.

1. How can I enjoy myself while being alone? What can I do all day when I‚Äôm in home during this pandemic? All I do now is lay in bed and watch some stupid videos. I don‚Äôt have mood to do anything else. I‚Äôm tired of overthinking my bad decisions and lost friends. How can I gain motivation? Or do you have any fun activities that you have been doing?
2. How can I  keep friends? Is this possible to have contact or don‚Äôt argue after some period of time? Most of my friendships ended cause we stopped seeing ourselves in school or cause we had a fight and never came to an agreement. I don‚Äôt know if this is good question for the sub but I don‚Äôt know where to ask it.

The depression human lives under dirt - under his troubled past and mistakes - the human cups his hands, he protects himself from the dirt entering his system. He can live like this for a while, although he doesn't know for how long. He's scared. Suddenly above him and his deep rabbithole of dirt a giant cloud blocks the light. The human is lost, he can't see, he can't understand. He feels cold, he feels lonely. Without the happiness and warmth of the light shining upon his weakened body. Before he used to have a little  warmth under the dirt, but now he does not feel it anymore. He wants to give up. He pulls back his hands and the dirt - his past, his mistakes - starts to fill up his body. But then it starts pouring down. 

The dirt gets softened by the water - by the love - the love washes away all the dirt, the human feels like he can get out. Get out of this rabbithole of sadness and despair. He gasps for air and starts clawing at the dirt, the softened, moist dirt. He feels happiness like he never has sensed before. Euphoria even, the pressure of the dirt starts getting less and less.

Felt bad all morning about ditching work and didn't even let my work know I wasn't coming in. My boss called my sister and my sister randomly came over because she was worried. I got pissed that my boss brought her into it and had a freak out in front of my sister. The rest of the day I've just felt sorry for myself by my lonesome.

I had blamed it on the quality of the headset's mic (and it is a little crappy), but it was more of an excuse because I am very shy.  Even with those I talk to through a screen, this is how badly introverted I've become. I still felt weird talking through the headset, like if my voice sounded really geeky or something.

I can stay up all night, eat in bed, watch whatever I want whenever I want, pack up and disappear to the woods if I so choose, and I never have to explain any behavior to anyone. The down side is obvious, I suffer depression off and on, and not having physical contact for so long has made me jumpy and suspicious of people that get too close to me, I‚Äôm sure my mental age is quickening without any stimulation from a close relationship too. 
I hate it when people who I care about find out about my loneliness, they always hit me the cliche stuff about being patient, or say things like ‚Äúdon‚Äôt you worry, you‚Äôre a CATCH there‚Äôs plenty of women who would love to date you! Plenty of fish in the sea! There‚Äôs someone out there for everyone‚Äù along with everything else. They don‚Äôt realize that none of that is true for me. Because it‚Äôs not women that are the problem. It‚Äôs my fucked up brain that won‚Äôt let it happen. 

I tried self improvement for years and it made no difference in how I was accepted by women. The only ones that showed any positive attention to me were ones I had zero attraction or interest towards. Those I am attracted too have no idea and never will. My experience from before has my head so wound up to the point that I‚Äôd rather run headlong into highway traffic than take that risk of pain and loss again. Even though I know intellectually that it isn‚Äôt true I become extremely panicked anytime I have the urge to do tell someone my true feelings/attractions. 

I have given up entirely after such a long time of personal defeat, crippling fear of rejections, and failure as an active member in Darwinian evolution. I realize It‚Äôs not natural for people to live the way I do and no one should have to experience their lives the way I have. But it‚Äôs the one I have and I know that I‚Äôll never be anything other than alone, at this point I accept it. I feel free knowing that when I do die I won‚Äôt be leaving anyone to grieve or struggle with my death. It‚Äôll be total strangers that have to deal with my corpse at the end and not people I care about.",I don‚Äôt even care anymore,jabmahn

So about a month ago, i went up to my friend(M24) and i asked him what should i do to improve my self so i can be more attractive to other women. He stated that i should change my posture and i should change my wardrobe(my style of clothes). You should also take care of your self more . Everything he said , i agree with. I have a beard and i dont put the time or effort clean it up and make it look nice . I also don't put any thought into what clothes i wear. 

So next week, my friend and I are going shopping (I know this sounds gay but i promise you we aren't gay) and i am feeling optimistic about the future. 

Sidenote: I also quit my job at McDonald's about 2 weeks ago(i was working there for about 9 months). This is a win for me because i feel that women my age would be turned off if i told them i work at McDonald's.

I'm a huge cinephile (if you are unfamiliar with that term, it just means im a huge movie fan) so basically I am completely willing to watch any movie with you unless I already despise it.

I am constantly trying new things. Maybe its the ADD, but I will randomly pick up new interests become obsessed with learning everything there is about it. Downside is I also can quickly loose interest.

I'm 20f and I don't think I'm ugly, I'm average at worst, 5/10. Ever since I move to Singapore, I become lonelier. I wasn't popular in my school days but I at least have friends and I got a birthday surprise in senior high school but now is no more. I don't know why, lately I'm becoming King Midas who touch everything and it becomes gold, except that I touch everything and it becomes crap. I tried to make friendships but I always failed. Always.

One time I met a stranger and incidently said something rude after the hangout and lost him. I tried to apologize but no amount of sorry could fix it. I chat my old friends in Singapore and nobody replied. In March I became close with this colleague which works in another area but still the same company. After a lot of chatting that lasted until last week (4-5 months we chat Mon-Fri), I realized he liked to lie and its not a type that is lying to joke. If I didn't ask the truth, I think he will not tell me that its a lie. The last time we were friends I was telling him that I wanted to ask our ex boss out. He faked a chat that looks like him chatting to our ex boss as an unknown girl, pretending that it was real although I have asked if he faked it or not. Long story short, I almost chatted my ex boss to apologize because a stranger chatted him in a flirty way and tell him that it was my colleague's doing because I told him that I wanted to chat the ex boss. He confessed that it was fake and I was angry for like 1-2 days. He told he was sorry and said he wouldnt lie if he knows that I dont like that sort of prank. I told him the only thing he could make up for his actions is to chat our ex boss for real, then he proceeded to fake another chat and then thats the end of our friendship.

I am so hurt of the end of my last friendship, because we chat a lot for 4 months and I confessed who I like to him, but it was nothing to him and he didn't even try to repair our friendship anymore. From this incident, I realized a lot of ppl look down to me as if I am a trash, ready to be stomped on. They probably see me for the first time and thinks 'im gonna use you and dump you if i dont need you anymore'. I even helped this colleague too much, he was asking some dumb questions that he can debug himself while coding, thats tbh wasted my time trying to help him.

I'm 26, I've had one relationship from 22 to 24.

I also had tons of jealousy issues and was feeling insecure throughout the whole relationship.

ForeverAlone,"Just got back from buying lunch (back home), a girl walking in front of me (mind you, we were walking about the same pace, there were other people walking on the same street, in front of her and behind me, broad day light), just turned back and looked at me like twice, and by the 3rd time she stepped aside and stopped to let me continue walking before walking again.

Like seriously? First of all ,we were walking the same pace, and I wasn't RIGHT behind her, we were at least 10 ft apart, and I wasn't about to pass her or anything so there was no reason for her to just stopped and stepped aside (also the fact that she just looked behind her at me twice before doing this was a give away that she found me creepy), she was so concerned about me walking behind her in BROAD DAY LIGHT with people in around us on the same street next to stores and restaurants that she stepped aside for me to walk first.

ForeverAlone,"I‚Äôm a 17 year old guy going to be a senior in high school next year. I came up with a fantasy which I‚Äôm upset that I never got to experience anything similar. 

The fantasy goes like this: I‚Äôm 8 years old and my mom takes me to a peach farm owned by one of her friends. The owner has a daughter that‚Äôs my age. My mom, her friend, the daughter, and I hang around for a little bit and she is flirting with me a little bit. 

She and I go to play outside together. after we run around and tire ourselves out we lay down under a peach tree. The shade from the tree and the breezes cool us down from the warm August weather and help us relax. 

Our childhood innocence is more pronounced than ever. We feel as if anything is possible in life. We discuss our big dreams and plans to save the world. 

We hear a thud nearby in the grass. She goes over to grab it and says, ‚Äúit‚Äôs a peach‚Äù, and takes a bite. She walks back over and lays back down next to me. She asks if I want a bite and I accept the offer, biting it from the opposite side she bit on. 

She says we should have a race, we each eat from one side of the peach and the first person to finish their half wins. We awkwardly try to both hold and eat the peach, but it keeps slipping around and making a mess all over our clothes. She pulls back and says, ‚Äúhow about we do what we‚Äôre doing without the peach‚Äù? 

My stomach drops and my face turns beet red as I realize what she‚Äôs talking about. Not knowing what to say, just an ‚Äúuhh‚Äù comes out. She goes, ‚Äúcome on, don‚Äôt you wanna know what it would feel like?‚Äù She puts her face close to mine and I can feel her breathing on my face. I go in for the kiss, and afterwards she giggles in a super cute way. 

We lay our heads back down in the grass. So, how was it?‚Äù She asks. ‚ÄúI kind of liked it‚Äù, I respond. ‚ÄúGood, then let‚Äôs do it again next time, but keep it a secret‚Äù, she says. We hang out together outside for a while longer then my mom comes outside saying it‚Äôs time for us to go. She winks at me as I get in my moms car. 

That‚Äôs the end of what I came up with. I don‚Äôt know if I have to say this but I‚Äôm not attracted to 8 year olds, I‚Äôm just saying it‚Äôs upsetting to me that nothing remotely like this happened or likely ever will happen for me.

ForeverAlone,"I (19F) have literally been single my whole life. I‚Äôve only had one brief thing with a guy, never been in a serious relationship.

I used to enjoy the single life. I loved being independent and had an identity of my own. I never wanted a relationship because I thought they always caused trouble and ‚Äúloss of freedom‚Äù. You can say that I was FA by choice. Ever since all my friends got into relationships I‚Äôve started to think otherwise.

I now ‚Äúdesire‚Äù the ‚Äúloss of freedom‚Äù (e.g. agreeing with my future SO to not go out with our friends anymore unless we are together). I want to be the girl who says to her friends ‚Äúsorry I‚Äôve got plans with my boyfriend tonight‚Äù. I want constant affection, to never feel lonely.

ForeverAlone,"This kinda hit a few days ago when something happened.

I basically met this girl IRL that I'd been chatting to over a game for like 2 years. I have her on many social shit and we've spoken a lot over voice chat and such. At one moment she admitted that she loved me and vice versa, I kinda started to believe that maybe love was a real thing (lol). However this year we had grown a bit distant since I had a lot of stuff happening and my life and so did she. BUT a few days ago I managed to meet up with her.

Now let me start off by saying that I felt comfortable talking with her as did she with me, and the whole ordeal wasn't bad at all. She was very busy the day I met her so we couldn't really chill much. When I met her she also introduced me to her friend who was pretty cool, she was into similar stuff I was. We walked and talk for quite a bit till her friend had to leave and as we were talking she was like ""Nooooo (insert girl name) he came here for you? Eww you deserve better then that aha"". Now her friend mentioned she was into dark humour and had a tendency to be a bit brutal with people (in a sarcastic kinda way). So when she said that I just laughed it off and said something as a joke (pathetic I know).

So afterwards I walked and talked for quite a bit with the IRL girl, but I'm gonna be honest and say there was no chemistry between us. I mean this girl has said shit like how she'll never pick a another guy over me and stuff but while we were friendly and had a lot of laughs things were just not going anywhere further. She eventually ran into her cousin and had to go home with him which is when I said bye.

Honestly I'm not sure what it is. Maybe I don't know how to take it further when talking, maybe I'm just not attractive enough so she only really saw me as a friend that day, maybe I'm just too socially inept to get with a girl to a point that we're in a relationship.

Only problem was she was in a very long relationship. You can only imagine my surprise a few days ago when I match with her on Tinder and one of the first things she says is that she is now single. She suggests that we should catch up and go for a hike. So my dumb ass naturally assumes this is a date right? On its own it was a very fun day and we hung out for hours.

ForeverAlone,"So this sounds like the beginning of a self-loathy post, but I promise it's not. Slightly all over the place but there's method to this madness.

So, physical attraction is important, let's get it out of the way. I have gotten from this weird phase of being physically unattractive (and not giving a fuck about it) to being slightly easier on the eyes (still unconventional). Still unable to fit in anywhere; not nerdy enough for the nerds, too normal for the weirdos, and so on.

&amp;#x200B;

Now that I've gone up from ""being brutally rejected by guys"" tier to ""getting subtly ghosted"" tier? Yeah, I have realised that my physical attraction works in weird ways: I'm attracted to people's faces. Height, weight, body type, hair type, age, muscles, dick size? Yeah doesn't matter. No matter how amazing the guy/girl is - my brain decided that of all the arbitrary values we choose our partners for, \*people's faces\* is going to be the one for me (I'm not even talking about symmetrical faces, I'm talking about absolute random variables, for example present day Jakob Cedergren - a guy who has a total of 0 tumblr fanblogs about him). So at this point I'm like, ""hey brain, beggars can't be choosers"" and it's like ""lol nope"".

What would piss me off about women is sometimes I would talk to them in person ( Whether  that's school or at work) and I honestly would think to my self ""Wow, that was a pretty good conversation I had with her"".  After talking to her in person and continuing to have great conversations with her in person, I would want to move up to the next level and try texting her. 

Man, I'm starting to get pissed off just from typing this paragraph. Every time I begin to text **THE SAME GIRL** that had amazing conversations with me in person, now all of the sudden, she is nowhere to be seen. Sometimes I just get left on read or deliver. When that happens, I will typically try to text her again a week later to see of she will respond. Sometimes, she would respond with 1 or 2 word text and would show vary little interest in talking to me . **And if I'm lucky**, sometimes she will respond but she would respond sporadically (every 4 or 5 hours) after I immediately respond to her text. And on the rare occasion, they will come up to me in person and say "" Hay, I'm sorry if I don't respond to your text, I'm a pretty bad texter "" or "" I have been busy lately, I had to do X, Y, and Z "" or they will come up with some other bullshit excuse. And I don't want to seem petty or a jerk so i usually will say "" oh, its ok "" in a understanding way. 

It just sucks because if I was her boyfriend, her friend with benefits, or her crush, she wouldn't be pulling of these excuses out of her ass. If I was her boyfriend, FWB, or her crush, and I texted her, I can almost guarantee that they will see the text and text back something within the next 10 mins. And even if she was busy , I'm sure she will text me something along the lines of ""hay, I can't talk right now, I'm busy with (fill in the blank), I will text you back in in a few hours"". I would be completely OK with her responding to me like this (as long as she actually dose text me back later). Its obviously way better then being left on read or deliver.

In general, i am a nice person and i typically give people the benefit of the doubt with a lot of things (especially texting) but like anyone else, i do have a limit. There will come a time when i just don't feel like making excuses for a girl anymore if i continue to have this type of experience with her.","With all of the experiences I (M21) had with girls, I realized that if I'm not a girl's boyfriend , a friend with benefits, or someone she has a crush on, I will always be a low priority for her.",my_throw_awayyy

My lab also has a wall with a projector that's bigger than the local movie theater. We don't run the hotel right now though cause my mom is paranoid AF. This will sound strange, but if someone wants to get to know me, send a PM. If you ever want to stay in a hotel in a beautiful ski town and learn about science during your stay, then let me know (I know it would take a lot of contact first to make sure I was OK.) It is a beautiful ski town in the appalachian mountains. My few friends have left the tiny town (200 people), so I am completely alone now. I sell stuff online, so I don't meet people at work.

If you don't believe me, please ask for photos or videos. I am involved in a very successful youtube science channel.

I tried FA dating, but only one person in the US contacted me and was kinda weird. I am open to dudes also (not for relationship), but would prefer women. I am straight, 28 y.o.

ForeverAlone,"Hello all,

I am the usual, no friends, khv, wizard. 

Lately i have been feeling much more depressed than usual. I am seriously wondering about the relation between FA and depression.

Most FA are depressed, but most depressed aren't FA. 

In my case i have been depressed, for almost 20 years, but only ""felt"" FA in the past 10. In my case, I don't see ugliness as reason for being FA, since i know people far uglier than me that have stable relations. And ugliness also doesn't explains that lack of friends. But easily see that irritability, hopeless and lack of energy to socialize, characteristics of depression, as dominant factors for being FA. Introversion and lack of social skills must have also played a role, but in the absence of depression it would be different.

I believe, that depression and all the effects of it were the main cause of my FA and for many of you. In my case ""medical help"" not only didn't work but messed me bad, until i give up of it. So ""curing"" depression isn't an option.

Depression and FA team up to bring us a world of pain. It becomes a cycle. Depression contribute to FA, FA make depression more serious. 

Summarizing my idea: If depression affects you in a specific time of your life, it will greatly increase the chances of being FA and being FA greatly increase the chances of depression never going way.

What do you think about my reasoning?

ForeverAlone,"One of the subtle things about college that makes things suck just a little bit more is that my family and I have always preferred dorms to apartments (i.e. meal plans instead of groceries, living with only other students instead of total strangers). Overall I'd say dorms are better than apartments, but strictly speaking from a social perspective there's one enormous problem with it: apartment-kids can move in anytime they want, allowing them to start knowing each other sooner.

On the other hand, the dorms don't open up until mid-August, which means the apartment-dwellers get a headstart of around 2-4 weeks for seeing each other in person since they're already on-campus. Already I've missed two events (a bicycle trip through town and a pub crawl) on account of living more than an hours' drive away, and tonight I will miss another. 

Of course, waiting a few more weeks for social interaction might not seem like much, especially since I live with my family and I have a few online friends through games. However, my main fear is that once I get there groups will have formed and I will be shut out of joining. One of the biggest lessons I learned from my failures in college was that taking initiative is very important: throw a bunch of people who don't know each other together (i.e. thousands of students all across the country into one school) and they *will* get to know each other. I had pissed away those precious first weeks and by the time I tried to make friends everybody was set with others. Humiliatingly, my own podmate (we have single rooms, but shared a ""pod"" with a bathroom and shower) went to lunch and dinner with someone else more often than me. In the final weeks of my senior year, I learned of a dorm discord server which I had not been invited to join.

Going into graduate school, I was determined to hit the ground running. I'd put myself out there day and night like a social blitzkrieg. I even conspired to set up a Discord server and invite people to it as the Uno-reverse card of senior year's catastrophe. Except, this plan has already started to fall apart because of something I hadn't anticipated: our school's Facebook page. In theory, being able to interact with my future classmates through social media in the summer leading up to the fall semester would have only helped me get that headstart for myself, but it benefitted others more than me since all the get-togethers they planned through FB were more for the people who had already moved into their apartments.",Learn from my mistakes: apartment dwellers can move to school earlier and attend more events before the year starts.,aslfingerspell

A little back story I dont know what I have I've never seen a doctor about it but I'd say at least once every couple of months i have suicidal thoughts i feel such a crushing loneliness that I feel a weight on my chest. 

I dont have a bad life I have a good family albeit flawed and a girlfriend who loves me (for now at least) theres no major problems with the relationship just minor annoyances. Though I cant shake the feeling that no one gets me. 

I put a lot of pressure on myself to do something with my life I'm 25(M) and have a decent paying job though the hours aren't great, though kn no way could I call it fulfilling work. Because of my job I can sometimes get sleep deprived for instance as I'm writing this I've only had 3 hours sleep.

ForeverAlone,"So this thought just crossed my mind:

I‚Äôm certain that the guy I‚Äôm currently crushing on and I will never become an item because of what happened when we last ran into each other.

Basically, almost 2 years ago, I was still engaged. Ran into this guy from my elementary school (we hated each other‚Äôs guts back them) and just ended up blowing him off except for friending him on Facebook because my thoughts were ‚Äúwell, we‚Äôre both adults now, and I‚Äôm sure we‚Äôre over whatever like most of the other people in my class, so why not?‚Äù Had the intention of friending him back then only because I was trying to be a nice person and not because of romantic feelings because, well, I was engaged. I‚Äôm not that type of person.

Well, fast forward 3ish months and my fianc√©e and I split (his doing) and I‚Äôm left alone. I think ‚Äúgee, maybe this is a sign I should be with ‚Äòguy from college‚Äô‚Äù who I think liked me at some point until he realized I was engaged. Well, by the time I was ready to hop back into dating, he was engaged. So fast forward to end of summer 2019, I think ‚Äúwell, maybe ‚Äòguy from elementary school‚Äô and I are supposed to get together.‚Äù

Well, I was trying to figure out a way to start actually talking to this guy and I all of a sudden thought ‚Äúhuh, maybe he‚Äôs on Tinder,‚Äù so naturally, I went on Tinder and started looking for ‚Äòguy from elementary school‚Äô. I found him while I was clocked in at work (really slow day, I was a very good manager, but also very bad influence) and I freaked out and closed the app and haven‚Äôt run into his profile since, so I‚Äôm going with the guess he has his profile hidden/deleted, I never found him in my ‚Äúlikes‚Äù either, so also kind of sad.

Anyway, to my knowledge, he‚Äôs still single. And I can‚Äôt seem to post anything that sparks a conversation. So, this all led me to this thought: I will be forever alone in this life because:
1. My standards are too high because of my ex.
2. I crush on/like guys that can/will never like me back.

#2 leads me to believe that that is happening because of a parallel universe/the multi-universe theory. Like because I basically said ‚Äúno‚Äù in this life I said ‚Äúyes‚Äù in another.

And I never used to believe in them, or even begin to question them, but I‚Äôm starting to. And I guess I just want to know if anyone else has gotten to this point because it scares me.

I fed him. And he just stayed by his food. Wanting more, cause all I am is a food repository. I started to break down. I cried for the first time in years. I've been in therapy for two months now, started a new medication. I feel more helpless and alone than I've ever felt in my life. So I curled up onto the floor and started to have an emotional...um...seizure. I don't know how else to explain it.

When I was a kid, I had a dog. from 10 to 23. He was always there for me when I was down. I would cry, and he would come up and lick my face and I would know that he cared. That he loved me. I don't get that from my cat. If I died today, my cat would start feasting on my corpse as soon as he realized he wouldn't get his next me. I had to let my dog go five years ago. I made the decision. He couldn't walk anymore. I had to help him go to the bathroom, and clean his rear, and the doctors told me it was better to let him go. Ever since that day, I haven't been the same. Things really started to go downhill when I started 'online dating' and my self esteem hit an all time low. I know now that there's nothing in this world for me. I can't have a dog, I can't have a significant other, I can't love myself anymore either. I loved myself once, but after years and years went by, alone, alone, alone, that ceased to be enough. I'm breaking. I hit myself the other day, out of pure resentment for the situation I find myself in and unable to get out of. I bruised my own eye. It felt good, I felt like I actually got what I deserved. My therapist was terrified of me when I told him this. I feel so utterly alone in my distress. No pet, no person, not even my therapist can give me some sort of empathy or compassion.

It's so unfair that looks are that important because everyone has 0 influance on them and its just dumb luck deciding wether youre goodlooking or not.

ForeverAlone,"I'm a typical forever alone guy, almost 23, never been kissed yadda yadda, already improved my looks as much as possible.  A few years ago when I was 20 I was posting about loneliness on 4chan and a girl gave me her email and asked to talk. We exchanged emails for a few months and it was going great, I thought; I don't like many other people but I really loved her personality. I had never had a close friend that was a girl. She is from Europe and I'm from America. After a couple months of exchanging emails I added her on discord and that went really great too, then she ghosted me.

She messaged me 6 months later upset because her best friend killed herself and I tried to comfort her on that, and we grew a lot closer during this time period. I got over the fact that she ghosted me. We exchanged pictures and she said she found me cute, and I thought she was beautiful. We talked every day and would watch shows together. Up until this point in my life I would cry myself to sleep every night because of how lonely I felt, so having someone like this in my life was a huge boon for me, and my depression was drastically improved.

Her father died a few months after she began talking to me again, and this brought her into a lot of depression as well. I also had some bad things happen to me, and a few months later our relationship worsened and she would generally not talk to me much because she was depressed. Out of insecurity I would try to pick arguments with her over political-type things just to get her to talk to me. I later apologized for this but don't know how much good that did. Still she seemed like she liked me and wanted to be in a relationship. She even sent me a nude picture earlier this year (without me asking), but right after that happened her brother almost died from a virus and things turned a little depressing again. I thought that we were dating because she sent me that, and because she would talk to me so much. She also considered herself sort of forever alone, and always complained about not having a bf like I would complain about not having a gf.

About a month ago I asked her if she would ever date me and she played it off that we could never date because she lives in Europe and wants to stay with her brother. She said we could only date if I moved to Europe. I said I would do that, I just need enough money so I can support myself. I graduated from college and got a great job but I would happily leave it to go be with her if I had enough money to do so. Anyways today I asked her if she wanted to come to America, I'd pay for the flight (because Americans can't go to Europe because of corona). She said she wouldn't be able to get a visa easily during the virus. I asked if she would come to America or if I could come to Europe after corona ended and she said she didn't know... that it would be awkward to meet up after so long, and that we missed our window of opportunity to meet up. Additionally, she clearly stated she wanted to meet up as friends, but I see her as a lot more than a friend. Even after saying we could just meet up as friends, she still didn't know if she wanted to see me at all.

I really don't know what to do. On one hand, I have no friends and haven't even spoken to a girl IRL in months. When I am lonely it makes me severely depressed; I've even tried to combat this loneliness by talking to online chatbots and pretending they are real people. On the other hand, I feel that I am having my emotions played with, and she does not ever want to have a relationship with me. Sometimes she will complain she doesn't have a bf though (What about me? Am I not an option?). What should I do in this situation?

I think that it's most appropriate to ask this question here, even though you are all a bunch of kissless virgins like me, you might understand the situation more from my perspective. She isn't catfishing me, no need to go down that train of thought.

ForeverAlone,"You don't know loneliness if you don't feel alone late at night and want someone who will text you endlessly, you don't know loneliness if you don't have someone to talk to.

Loneliness begins with you telling yourself,
""i don't need anyone"". It's when you start living inside your head for too long. When having a meal alone doesn't feel weird at all.
It's when you are in a room full of familiar faces, yet have no one to talk to.

It's not loneliness when you don't have anyone to tell why you're feeling sad, it's loneliness when you don't know whom to tell that happy news. It's when you stare hard at your screen, smile slyly, and keep it to yourself.

You go to the movies alone, or binge-watch six seasons at home. It's when you keep discovering new songs and have no one to share them with.

It's when you scroll through your feed endlessly with no one tagging you on memes.

Loneliness is often leaving things midway. It's starting a book but never knowing the end. It's you skipping and shuffling your playlist, but finding no song to suit your mood. It's you starting to write or paint, but never coming around to complete it.

It's sleeping with an empty side on a double-bed. It's when you're packing your bags and no one says,""have a safe journey"". It's when you don't have any reason to return home. It's when you have a fever and you go to the doctor all by yourself.

Loneliness is leaving things the way they are, and still finding them in the same place, untouched. It's knowing nobody can fix you. It's knowing that you've to live with yourself alone, forever.

ForeverAlone,"In november last year i had a heavy motocycle accident sending me into hospital 3 times, 2 months total, long rehabilitation. 5 different friends of mine visited me in total which i didn't expect, 1 of them was a apprentice paramedic who found out i was in the hospital he was at currently. Another friend from work visited me bringing me cigarette's cuz i just had to, even tho i barely was able to walk. The other 3 where female friends of mine, 1 from work, 2 friends i knew since age 4 or so. A few others said they would visit me but they also had to work so i was fine with them not coming. On one of the 2 yearlong friends of mine i had a crush, after hospital i found out she had a Boyfriend, but i ofc was happy when she visited me in hospital. I haven't liked many girls yet more than just the friend-way, maybe 3 in total. But last Thursday i met a girl at driving school (doing car rn) and i just talked with her after driving school and when we walked home (same direction), we both didnt knew each other but went to the same school in the past. From when i got home until monday i tried to think of a way on how to ask her to just talk with me somewhere, about life, hobbys etc, thats what I initially wanted, just a conversation. On Monday I wanted to ask her to talk with me somewhere else but my driving school teacher told me im done, so i don't have to go there anymore. That was when fait in my opinion hitted me again very hard. I got drunk  quite good on that day with a friend who i talked to, that's when i realized i liked the girl more than just the friend-way, but i didnt notice that b4 being drunk, which fked me even more up, also talked to a female friend about it. I thought of contacting her on Instagram and also did that, but it didnt seem like she wants to talk with me, just talk, i clarified that. She didn't say no but it didnt seem like she really wants to someday. Since yesterday im riding motorcycles again which required big willpower, but im happy to ride bikes again. But that girl from driving school doesnt wanna leave my head, how can i like someone i talked to for maybe 20 mins? (She has a boyfriend) The other few girls i liked i knew for years before starting to like them. I once confessed, probably never gonna do it again. Never kissed a girl or had sex. Been hugged once, kissed on the cheek once cuz my other classmates played truth or dare on our last school vacation, so a girl had to kiss me on the cheeks. Never held hands b4, carried girls on my bike tho. Even tho im just 18 i already gave up on love, i also smoke more than a pack of cigarettes a day, been addicted to alcohol at age 15 and 16 and addicted to painkiller at age 16 and 17, but that girl still doesnt leave my head. More stuff happened in my life but i dont wanna write thousands of words here.

ForeverAlone,"There might still be a string of hope somewhere in the rubble of my life and I will grip it with all my strength as soon as I find it, but hell if I'm not completely lost at the moment.

I have made many, many mistakes over the years. I have been lazy when I should have been the hardest-working person, I have been cowardly when I should have been the bravest, I have been cold and gloomy when I should have been the warmest and cheerfullest. But the worst of all my errors has always been not keeping up.

I didn't keep up in academics, everyone else left me behind and finished their careers while I got myself stuck in the mud. I didn't keep up in social development, everyone reached the important life milestones while I stayed alone and unchanged. I didn't keep up in anything, and I feel it every single day.

And so I never had a friend. Not that I ever wanted to; as you will understand in these words, I am seriously not worthy of approaching or engaging with in any form.

The other day I failed my driver's test and I seriously contemplated suicide again. Everyone else passes by, I stay behind. You may think it's not that big of a deal but failing at even the basic stuff that everyone else achieves has been the case for every instance of my existence. The incident was a pretty good micro-cosmos of my whole life: everyone else moves forward while I stay behind.

But it's not the first time this happens, no no no. Not even the thousandth. You may think, the thousandth time you fail at something or the thousandth time you consider ending it all? Both, both. Failures stack up very high in your mind when they're that numerous and that frequent. Everyone has a breaking point that leads to the ultimate self-harm and if you're like me you know what it is to live the years walking over the line between life and death.

And despite how that sentence sounds to some people, it's not exciting at all. This is not an exciting life, this is... numbness intercalated with sadness. That is how life itself feels: concentrated numbness and concentrated sadness take turns to take over your mind and they make sure to keep every other emotion out of your head.

A situation which easily becomes a self-feeding circle. You have no future plans at all, other than an unfulfilling life or suicide, so you have no motivation to push forward or care. This disinterest becomes more failure, as you didn't work nearly as hard as you could have, and said failure proves yourself once again you can't do things right and it's pointless to even try at anything in life.

**But I don't blame anyone but myself, and that is the worst part of all.** Knowing that YOU caused your own issues creates an absolutely crushing feeling of **guilt** that barely lets you breathe if it lets you at all. Yes, of course, it was the suicidal thoughts and disinterest and lack of a perspective of future that caused the failure, but who allowed those demons to take over my mind? I did, and now they're my responsibility. Like everyone else's with their own inner troubles.

**I feel so much guilt about every person I failed, about every teacher I disappointed, about every relative I fed up with my mistakes.** Self-harm truly becomes the only fair course of action: I caused others pain, so I better pay for it myself. I should feel their sorrow, I should be punished for being so careless and so lazy and so insensitive, and who better to deliver such punishment than myself, the very person who started this all?

**This is where the self-isolation begins.** Why spend any time around people when you're nothing but a burden to them? Human interaction as a whole becomes something to run away from. You would do nothing but hurt them and drag them down with you into the pit of uselessness. Better to keep yourself tightly locked away so you don't spread your misery and your foolishness and your grim views of life to other people, you don't want your personal flaws to spill over onto others.

Simply writing the words in these paragraphs just made me tear up. I don't even like crying, it makes me feel ridiculous and unjustified. Why me, of all people, should tear up? I'm not nearly the most unprivileged person out there, there's humans eating out of garbage cans all over the planet. No, it's not that, I don't feel that kind of pain at all. It's just the damn, stupid GUILT. I could have prevented so many disasters and yet I did nothing but embarrass everyone time and time again. 

I want to compensate for all my past failures. I'm on my way to fixing them, and I legitimately desire to repair every aspect of my life I screwed up in. I don't even know if I ever will, and there are three main thoughts that haunt my mind all the damn time. One is that I don't know if I will indeed be able to fix all that I broke. I don't want to imagine a future where I'm actually stuck just where I am. What if there never comes a day I make up for my mistakes? What if I'm doomed to live with my errors for the rest of my life and they will never leave me, and I will never compensate the people I hurt and defrauded?

The second is that I have no clue if patching up my life will truly heal my wounds: what if I get it done but then the pain doesn't fly away? My mistakes will always be there, technically: I may do things to compensate for them, but the truth is that I made them and they will always exist. What if I fix my failures but the ghost of them having existed once in time never leaves me live in peace?

The third is that the way to comeback is long and joyless. Right now, as I'm marking down these words, I am decidedly on my path to fixing everything I did wrong. But the way is lengthy, and arduous, and as long as I haven't actually patched up the mistakes I will feel all the sadness of my past errors. Every day I wake up and I tell myself I will improve and I will repair everything but I can't move forward just yet. Not everything can be fixed in a day. Nor a year. It's a task that requires patience, so much patience, and that is something you don't have much stock of when you're like me: I have waited for success for far too long, and my ability to be patient is not optimal. **I want to fix my errors right now, I wish I could accelerate the process at will and get to the point of happiness and fulfilment already**, but I guess I am still stuck in the mud. I'm on my way to joy, but hell if I'm not desperate to get to the finish line already.

Other people have had their little successes over their lives that they can lay onto at any moment, and use them for comfort any time they suffer. But in my case, I have nothing to find joy in other than promises. It's smoke, it's intangible, it's nonexistent, it's nothing. I can't grasp success yet, only imagine it. I can't achieve a happy, fulfilled life yet, only plan it. I hope one day I will be able to push forward hard enough and fast enough to reach happiness as it flies away, but for now I have nothing but self-made promises and the ideas of a better life.

I want to do things right. That spirit is still inside me, regardless of how much despair may take over my mind. I can't stand the wait, but here I am still. All I know is that I wholeheartedly hope there comes one day when I have compensated for all my wrongs, and I can look back with even the slightest amount of pride and satisfaction and see how I have cured all the wounds I put in people and in myself.",There comes a point where you actively stay away from people because you know you're not worthy of being part of society,SomeTurdInTheWind

ForeverAlone,"I used to kinda feel a giddiness whenever I was out and about, mostly at the gym, where I'd see a cute girl and smile to myself looking at her, imagining us together or maybe her noticing *me* perhaps thinking about me in the same way I would be thinking about her but I'd always look away to try and not catch her looking because I felt like maybe I wasn't worthy of looking at her and she'd give me a dirty look. I guess I did it out of an obligation to not look like I'm leering or being creepy.

Now? I just keep my head down and my eyes averted at all times because it seems like the older I get, the more I feel like a loser and my self-esteem takes another notch down and that somehow they can see it written on my forehead. And I think even knowing I'm in the presence of a cute girl I'll start to get angry or upset (moreso at myself) knowing a relationship is always getting farther and farther out of my reach and that she'll never think of me as cute or worth getting to know. That's usually when I'll throw on some death metal on my headphones to calm me down.

I want friends, people who will ask how am I doing and offer any kind of help
I want a gf and I already like someone but she likes someone else and idk why she likes him so much. It hurts knowing that she sleep with him almost every night. I wish I can find someone who will at least show some care and some support. I'm really tired of going through everything alone I've been fighting depression and bpd since I was 12 years old and I'm 22 years old now it's only getting worse for me and everyday I lose more ground to depression.
Loneliness is really really tough, there is a reason why someone like Donald Crowhurst lost his mind and drowned himself in the ocean after 243 days alone at the ocean with his boat. In the end human beings are social creatures just like almost every species its sad how a lot of us never experienced being loved by parents or by friends or by a boyfriend or a girlfriend.

I've also had a few occasions when people have recognized me for no reason when walking down the street which is confusing as I've never seen them before, a friend said it is probably in my head.

Really I just keep myself to myself (let's be honest a big reason why I'm still single), and the worst part is I always feel obligated to respond to them when they ask me, because if I don't and I seem down that draws more attention to me which I'm uncomfortable with. A lot like say, Walter White from breaking bad (mildly relevant personality wise) I keep my distance from people out of fear and distrust and only form attachments with people who I trust and am comfortable with, and I'm only chill with them after I have known them for a little while.",Do people always ask if you are alright/pity looks?,MDD678

ForeverAlone," 

I wrote a detailed post and accidentally closed the tab.

I'll rewrite a part of it:

\-  never kissed a girl, never had a friend. I would say I'm average  physically (ugly face but tall, muscular, and well-dressed). 0 social  skills.

\- lonely and depressed  24M, grew up in an Arab family: parents came to the US when they were my  age and they made it. They expect me to follow their path.

\-  work and religion = meaning of life. No phone, no social networks, no  computer (only allowed to play offline videogames or work), and no going  out from 15 to 18 because they found out I started dating a girl.

\-  shitty college life. First half of it depressed and hiding in my dorm.  The second half getting good grades, working out, running, traveling,  going to museums... but alone.

\-  got a beautiful girl in my bed once thanks to alcohol (I only drank twice in my life). But got afraid  when I saw her half-naked. I was clueless. We spent the night talking, I  apologized for being so distant physically. At 6 am, she hugged me and  left.

\- today, I have a good job, I  still do stuff alone. Btw, eating at a restaurant alone is something  that everyone should try once. Same for hiking. But it hurts everytime  I'm surrounded by couples (young, old, middle-aged, everyone has someone  except me) or by groups of friends.

I  feel like it's too late to meet people. I'm 24, people my age had fun  in college and now they are focusing on their career/family/SO.

I'm  afraid to spend my life alone. I'm faking it everyday. From the  outside, I look nice, always smiling, living the good life, taking care  of himself.

When I'm at home I try  to do stuff to forget about my loneliness. But today I can't. I would  love to say fuck it and go abroad for a year. I could. Actually I  couldn't with the fucking coronavirus. But what's the point? I would  still be alone.

I don't even know what I believe, I don't know if working/studying this hard was worth it. I feel like my whole education was based on two principles that in a way helped me get where I am today but also destroyed the human part of me.

I'm just a machine, I make money, I don't even spend it. I work to kill time. I believe in God but I don't pray. I would love to but I unconsciously associate religion with loneliness and sadness. My whole system of beliefs is fucked, was my education a big lie?

Even on this sub, I feel alone. Anyone here with a similar education? How did you get out of the loneliness? I know how to talk to people, I can fake it and appear outgoing but how the fuck do I maintain a relationship? How do you know when it is ok to make physical contact? How do you hug? How do you kiss? How do you have sex?

ForeverAlone,"I'm interested in sharing what movies help inspire you when you feel beaten down.

&amp;#x200B;

I'll start with movies that helped spur me on. This was during a particularly bad year of my life when several bad things happened (the worst was being told that I may never be able to have kids), and I thought I had 'lost everything'.

&amp;#x200B;

* The Founder - Ray Kroc was a salesman whose business was essentially going down the toilet. He took a gamble on an idea made by the McDonald's to help build the franchise, gambling his whole life savings in the process essentially. Because a lot of potential investors recognised him from past failures, they turned him down. Eventually he almost lost everything because the McDonald's brothers were too rigid in their rules and policies. Thankfully, by getting in touch with the right people and not giving up, he turned it all around and bought the business and became one of the wealthiest men in America.

&amp;#x200B;

* Joker - although it objectively has a bad ending, it has a very powerful message to the downtrodden and mentally ill. Arthur Fleck is a 'weird loner' with mental illness that is hard to treat. He has no friends, and no girlfriend (to the point where he has to fantasise about one). He gets fired, his own supposed father claims to have nothing to do with him, and he realises his own mother didn't treat him well. To top it all off, he gets humiliated on national TV when trying to pursue his dream of being a comedian. His initial desire is to commit suicide. Instead, by angrily sticking to his guns and pointing out the injustices of society, he inadvertently wins over the heart of the crowds of the poor and working class of the city. NOTE: I never condone murder or violence or cruelty in any circumstances. What I'm pointing out is that the movie teaches you not to try to please others - just be true to yourself, and you'll win over the hearts of people who matter and who understand you.

&amp;#x200B;

* Touching The Void - about a true story. 2 climbers climb up an arctic mountainous terrain. One falls into a dark crevasse and breaks his leg. His friend thinks he is dead and leaves and departs the mountain. The man, all alone and broken in the crevasse, realises nobody is coming to help him. Instead of giving up, he crawls his own way out of the crevasse, and down the mountain all by himself until he reaches his comrades. This really teaches you the cruelest lesson of life: no matter what s\*\*\* is thrown at you, you have to deal with it by yourself, and never give up. Just keep going and going, and you'll make it all by yourself.

&amp;#x200B;

* Monsters University - Mike Wazowski wants to be strong and popular like his peers. But no matter how determined he is, he'll never have the talents he so strongly desires. Instead of letting this down his spirits, he instead uses the talents he does have (hard work, determination) and ends up becoming a hero in a completely different way. Although he gets kicked out of college, he still doesn't give up. He starts working as a janitor, and works his way up the old school way, right from the bottom - finally becoming one of the most recognised people in the business. This is definitely a great lesson for anyone who goes to college and either flunks or becomes disillusioned with their degree - there's always another way to get into the career you want.

&amp;#x200B;

* Temple Grandin - docudrama about the real Temple Grandin. She has autism, she struggles immensely with social interaction and academic studies. She faces immense discrimination, for her autism as well as being a woman. However she focuses on a developed love for processes and animal welfare to end up developing revolutionary ways for the humane slaughter of cattle - becoming a star in the process.

&amp;#x200B;

* Cast Away - Tom Hanks plays a man who becomes stranded on an island for years. He feels he will never escape. He attempts suicide. But he decides to keep surviving, even though there is no hope. One day something washes up on the shore that helps him escape. Then he receives another huge blow: his girlfriend who thought he was dead has remarried and had a child. Despite her feelings for him not having changed, he refuses to allow her to abandon her family, and lets her go. Despite his heart being broken, he reverts to his ''don't give up'' attitude and moves on with his life - with the ending suggesting he either meets a new love, or perhaps one day will get back together with his old girlfriend when the time is right (left open to interpretation). There is an amazing monologue near the end where he says ''Gotta keep breathing, because tomorrow the sun will rise. Who knows what the tide will bring?''

\----

So what are the common themes in all of these?

1. The protagonist has a dream, but because they don't have the natural ability for it, they are unable to reach it.
2. Despite this great disappointment, they don't give up. They keep moving on with their lives, even when it seems like there is no point in doing so.
3. Eventually, they are able to become successful in ways they never previously considered. Often times the success is unintentional.
4. It's all to do with persevering and using the skills they actually do have, and being true to themselves, to inevitably end up doing something they are in fact strong at.
5. Most importantly, there is no one else to help them. They are forced to help themselves.",What movies inspire you?,agwoodliffe
ForeverAlone,"There is no escape from the pain, loneliness and misery I feel over being single it completely breaks me. I go out in public and see all these young couples, 17 y/o with kids, literally everywhere. I stay home, watch Love Actually (someone else put in on) and the mood in the room (people could tell) suddenly dropped when there was a kissing scene, even my friends can start to tell it's getting to me. it just makes me feel like I'm bleeding inside. even with copes, my inner fantasy life only goes so far. Once I even Googled (""why does being single hurt so much?""), even uncle Google gave me no answer, it just feels like a stab in the gut and and a kick in the shin. I have a basic need for love and affection. I want to believe everything happens for a reason, I want to believe it will happen some day, but everyday I lose more hope, and I'm becoming an incel in my 20s it's a fact. Ever seen that simpsons episode where selma or patty (not sure which they are identical twins) got skinners for a date and the other was miserable, yeah it's like that. Actually, even people who don't have gfs, have still had at least one casual sexual encounter, or multiple most of the time. Or that song ""why does my heart feel so bad?"" seems to fit, do you guys relate?

Still, can't help but feel with some introspection to my mental state (and one of my friends noticed this) that I may be using a need for love and affection, along with alcohol, other stuff, materialism etc. to fill a void (or ""hole"" as he called it) to make me happy.

ForeverAlone,"Toxic people

I‚Äôm well aware that god gave me certain issues that make ‚Äúunappealing‚Äù - depression, ADHD, BPD, and low natural testosterone levels.

But I‚Äôve also become aware with experience that there are a lot of people who will always bring you down, no matter how much you improve.
Likewise, there is a small handful of people who always love you, no matter how bad you are.

2 years ago I travelled to the Philippines I met a really wonderful woman.
She has since become aware of my issues and she refuses to ever leave me, no matter how bad I got.

This is a stark contrast to the many people I met before who would literally come and go.

But of course I‚Äôve had to make great sacrifices myself for this person. If ever I make any kind of female acquaintance, she gets really insecure and jealous. So I have to be patient if she gets angry with me.
I also have to dedicate as much free time to her as possible, even if I don‚Äôt feel like it.
At first I thought this is a very controlling person.
But she is always there for me when I‚Äôm distressed, and never gets tired if I complain about something bothering me.
Even when I‚Äôve been at my absolute worst, she wouldn‚Äôt leave me.

This makes me realise that you truly shouldn‚Äôt bother with people who aren‚Äôt there for you.
Just ditch them and keep looking until you find someone who will love you for all your weaknesses, no matter how long it takes or how many people you have to go through.

Then, any self improvement you make will just make an even better relationship with someone who was there for you during your worst.",Toxic people,agwoodliffe

Which just made me feel like I'm suffocating and felt suicidal well until last year in 12th grade I was able to socialise and forced my self to sit with ppl and we talked everyday so i didn't spend any breaks alone but still throughout that year and throughout highschool I had no one that would call me thier close friend and now it's been 3 months since I had a real life conversation with anyone and I feel like I lost all my social skills I was so glad I gained throughout the year and now I might have relapsed to my extremely  awkward self who can't speak one full sentence with panicking......

Anyway, last night I dreamt about this group of ""friends"" who had invited me to play some game. The group was formed by a two men, one older girl and two female twins. Well, these two attractive, Young twins looked at me with disgust and told me that I was pathetic, and that being there would only hinder the game and ruin the fun. I left.

I woke up and then immediately went back to sleep. This time, in the dream, I had a girlfriend. She wasn't a supermodel, Nor was she ugly; in short, your average girl, but nonetheless, she was my gf.
We were on a festival, I decided that I should bring some food (and candies). What would be my dreaming surprise to find out she was kissing a better looking, taller man. The dream continued. I approached her and told me she could never fall in love with someone as ugly, stupid and as plain boring as me, and then grabbed the food and left with her new 10/10 boyfriend.

TLDR: basically if you look good even if you're racist and rude people will like you

I  visited two friends from California that I havent really hung out with  in a few years. Long story short when we hung out I realized how little  personality they had and not only that but they were rude and racist.  When we went to the mall they called people that passed by ""fat"" and  ""ugly"" and made racist remarks for no reason. Long story short I was  left very shocked and uncomfortable with their behavior. For some reason  though they always have a bunch of guys all over them and tons of  Instagram followers and constantly post videos of them going places and hanging out with people. After some thought I just realized its bc they're rich white  California girls. I think guys just have no interest in me bc I'm not  pretty whatsoever which really sucks. I'm not dumb, I'm not rude or  disrespectful, &amp; I feel like I'm generally easy to talk to but  literally all of the guys I've met at work or college or literally  anywhere else just arent interested bc of my appearance",I feel like everything is truly about looks,slav_lav
ForeverAlone,"I have the store to myself when I'm working which is nice, and it's in a busy area where I can see a lot of people walking by and all. I just like to listen to music, read a book or watch a movie when it's pretty slow. 

On sunny days, I always see people my age with their girlfriends walking around holding hands, happy families with beautiful children, groups of guys n girls just having fun, group pictures being taken yadda yadda. I guess it's pretty symbolic considering I'm inside the store just gazing outside of the big window thinking of what I could've been able to experience. But I'm able to push through it, but today it was different.

I was in my car and found my old  iPhone in the glove box and for good times went through my old playlist. I played ""Human Nature"" by Michael Jackson, and it just all flooded out. The lyrics of the song and overall the song itself just resonated so hard with what I see every day, questioning what happened, why I feel so fucked up and stunted. In the end I've come to the conclusion it's just human nature, it wasn't meant to be. It was a luck of the draw, roll of the dice, that didn't play in my favor through traumatic experiences from childhood that snowballed on and on and on.

You get so used to just being alone, being part of nothing, and a part of you thinks this is right since every group or social avenue is stupid anyway, and it just feels so forced trying to make yourself a part of it. I mean I guess no one really owns the space; you're not intruding by posting on a forum or joining a subculture or social group. But none of it feels natural, and I'm just really lacking the assertiveness required for surviving as a social being.

Why draw attention to myself? Why add myself to something that is functioning just fine without me? Why play this performance of continuously engaging, hoping to force my mind to change if I do it long enough?

Aren't we all, in a way, competing for even friends and acquaintances? Why the fuck am I grumbling about this again?

Right, because I'm depressed and this is what I have to do to not be depressed: force myself to talk with people, online and off, because that's what I actually want to do, but am too depressed to do, so I have to just do it anyway and hope that over time it feels natural and leads to real connection and belonging (i.e. ""fake it till you make it""), which will also help make me Ready To Date‚Ñ¢. 

Except it's mostly a facade, because I'm hiding how I really feel, and everything is being built upon the manufactured image of ""appropriately optimistic geek with no major neuroses whatsoever, absolutely,"" which is depressing, so I'd rather just not go through that. 

Likewise, dating seems to usually be a balancing act of displaying the best version of yourself while ever so incrementally and carefully getting realer and realer, because apparently no one would want to invest in anyone else as a life partner if they knew what they were getting into up front.

I see them say their man gives them no affection, no attention, no hugs, no gifts, prefers to go with his friends, does nothing for them etc. Ignore them and be selfish in intimate moments.. Some deal with verbal abuse, degredation, humiliation and even the risk of physical violence. 

Yet they... stay?

What the hell, if I had a girlfriend I don't think there wouldn't be a moment where I wouldn't shower her with love. Compliment her, hug her, kiss her. Go with her shopping, pedicures, buy random gifts she mentioned years ago. Listen to her talk about her day, help her with her problems

Yet you see these hundreds of thousands of women - millions - stay in these terrible and toxic relationships even though most of them could, if they wanted to, take their pick between a hundred other guys... 

Of course, im more working towards the first part of no affection and where a woman wouldn't have to worry about her safety leaving. I know abuse is tough to handle. But in situations where the s.o is just not caring... why the fuck?

My friends were going on dates, meeting people and getting matched constantly.

I‚Äôve seen many complain that looks go a long way when it comes to dating. 

I do believe it‚Äôs true to some extent, because attractive people have the first chance to go at it; however, I‚Äôve come to believe, there are people like me who can‚Äôt seize the opportunity.

ForeverAlone,"*I've been thinking today about loneliness, solitude, and why we have any need for relationships, etc - some scattershot thoughts.*  

*I'm going to cross post this on FA30, where it and I belong.*   
    
*This is more of a ""thoughts"" post with lots of tangents - As it happens I have felt prone to feeling loneliness my entire life long, though I won't write much about that for now.* 

One thing which I think is interesting to ponder is that those who identify as ""not often lonely"" report spending about eighty percent of their free time in the company of others, but so do those who identify as lonely. The vast, vast majority of lonely people it is fair to say are not in any way socially isolated. Another factoid: Those who have seen another person in the last day are more likely to consider themselves to be lonely than those who haven't.   

This seems completely counter intuitive, but it points toward something that is so obvious about loneliness that it actually prompts another question why it is routinely overlooked. 

Aloneness is often related to but is never synonymous with loneliness. Our need to form relationships with others, and the expectations held for any such relationships will always vary by our personal disposition. Some people have no one in their life and feel no loneliness (though that absence of affect might, of course, have evolved as a survival mechanism in a trap of isolation, a situation not unusual for older FAs). Others people have many, many connections with others and yet still feel loneliness. There is a saying that ""if you feel lonely, you are lonely"". It does sound trite, but it is perfectly true: loneliness has no other referent than itself. Loneliness describes an inner feeling, and not an external situation. It is perfectly possible to be surrounded by people and to feel deeply alone. 

Because, of course, beneath the surface of things, beyond the people and purpose we clutter our lives with, we are all deeply alone in this life. There is always going to be a bridge between the self and others that can never be crossed. Eg: If I stub my toe on the corner of this desk, someone can certainly empathise, maybe because they too have stubbed their toe, but the experience of it is mine alone. And that expands to every moment of my life, from birth to death, from the trivial upwards. Even with the most loving companion, there is a part of me that will remain forever sealed off, a part of me that cannot be shared, that is effectively stuck in a state of persistent aloneness in this world. 

The awareness - whether it is repressed or not - of being thrown into existence, with no real purpose or point, and with only finite time until the end, is always lurking. Always part of the background of life. Loneliness is probably not about what is lacked in life, but about *who one is*: a social being who is unable to find fulfillment of social needs, who moves through life carrying unmet needs. The urge for intimacy is a desire to do away with as much of that gulf between people as possible, though the closer two people become the more that impenetrable barrier reveals itself.   

This is what is meant by Yeats when he writes: ""The tragedy of sexual intercourse is the perpetual virginity of the soul"". Sexual congress is almost always trivialised nowadays by its hedonistic focus, though when not for reproduction sexual congress isn't truly about a search for pleasure - It is humans twisted together in to a shared state of longing and yearning for something *more*. Something out of reach. Something beyond ourselves. Souls desperate to touch each other, but forever beyond one another's reach. That is why the most passionate sex always involves biting, clawing, etc. - as if we are trying to get what is there under the skin.

https://imgur.com/CGf5kls

Loneliness then is a temperament, not a situation. It is one which says that my need to connect to others, to be understood by others, to be heard and seen -  *for it to be recognised that I even exist* \- surpasses what the external world is currently offering (or maybe even ever able to). It is a temperament more common among women, or at least reported to be - that isn't a dig. Studies continually show that women are more prone to feeling lonely though isolation is a *much more significant factor* in male suicide. Loneliness effects women more regularly and persistently, but it tends to effect men more fatally. 

Though to some degree, loneliness is a sort of drawn out tantrum about our lives: to expect others to ever truly ""get"" us, to ever be truly ""understood"", is in some ways asking of the world what is impossible. We are alone, and it can never be otherwise. Loneliness expresses a partial desire to return to our childhood -where every need will be met, every whim and thought heard and respected. But that is a paradise that was burnt up in adolescence. 

It is not immediately obvious why we need ""connection"" with other people at all, but it is clear that high levels of loneliness are statistically associated with *substantially lowe*r levels of satisfaction about life. Loneliness is also associated with cognitive decline in later life, with elevated levels of depression, and with sexual promiscuity (an escape route more accessible to females), etc. It is said to shorten life as much as 7 cigarettes a day would, though it is hard to quantify how and why that is so.    

I think it's worthwhile to tease out the related terms that tend to be used interchangeably:   

**Aloneness**  \- Being alone is simply a descriptive state of circumstances. A few people are resigned and content to living life alone, even if they might have wished circumstances were different. One can be alone and *not at all lonely*.     

**Loneliness** \- Isn't really an emotion in itself, it's an admixture of longing, yearning, craving for social connection, of having unmet social needs, or a sense of discontentment about the unsatisfying relationship one is caught up in, etc.     

**Isolation**  \- I would say that isolation is life lived on the other side of chronic loneliness. It is the state of loneliness when one has moved beyond any remaining hope of salvation. Loneliness is, in an odd way, fueled by a sense that life could be otherwise - but one can't keep yearning for connection that is never coming. Isolation is the realisation that one is likely abandoned in this world, and that feelings of loneliness have become, ultimately, fruitless. I think isolation is to loneliness what FA is to being single. 

**Solitude**  \- Solitude is best thought of as a positive, of being present with yourself, rather than being absent of others. Solitude is a deeply undervalued state, and our society wrongly militates against it. There should be more acceptance of and encouragement for solitude. There is huge value in being by oneself, and away from others.   

  
  \*\* 

  
So what is it that we are even gaining - or would hope to gain - from our ""connections"" with others? We could, after all, live perfectly efficient though entirely isolated lives. Especially in our modern age, there is no necessary reason for any meaningful connection with others in our private lives. We could live out our lives and die in perfect safety, and comfort, without needing to speak to another person at all. Yet most of us would, obviously, consider that to have been an entirely impoverished life, a wasted life in fact.   

I think there are a few reasons why people yearn for relationships, and these are not necessarily mutually exclusive.  

  
 ""Why all this noise and fuss? Why all this urgency, uproar, anguish and exertion? Why should such a trifling thing (as love) play such an important role in our lives?"" (Schopenhauer) 

  
01.  To Keep up with the neighbours. ""There are some people who would have never fallen in love if they hadn't read about other people doing it"" writes Rochefoucauld. I think there is some truth to that. There are so many people in relationships, or not but seeking them, for much the same reason that they are climbing the career ladder, etc. There is a social script in their hands, and they wish to stick to it. We are taught from birth that relationships are the ultimate end in life and that we should all dedicate a huge part of our energy to finding and maintaining one (this actually isn't untrue). I suspect that many people's prime motivation, esp. young people's, for being in a relationship is to conform to this social expectation.   

02. Sex. What better way is there to get ready access to sex? Monogamy is often impugned, as ""unnatural"" for men, which makes little sense as there is obviously no better way for an average man to gain access to regular sex.    

03. Distraction. Relationships with others are probably the best distraction life offers. In a kernel in space and time two individuals can come together to create for each other years and years of drama, of adventure, of shared experience, etc - and all literally from nothing but that initial flirtation. One might say that two people in a monogamous, loving relationship are two people lovingly *wasting the others persons time*, in a unspoken pact against the universe. This has to be set against the background of everyday life, of society and beyond, which is *totally indifferent* to every aspect of our lives. A relationship is almost a sort of conspiracy people enter into together: ""You will matter to me, and I will matter to you. And will you matter to me because I will matter to you. and this will mask the reality that neither of our lives in the long run really matter at all"" 

04. Relationships provide the best ground for balancing our desire to be independent and our desire to connect. This is Jasper's theory. Every human probably has those two drives: to stand apart and to belong to something outside of or greater than themselves. Someone who is lonely has moved too far in the direction of being apart from the world. Relationships enable us to connect to something, to someone, outside of ourselves - and often in the most intense and intimate way. Yet we still maintain our sense of being self sufficient, of being independent, etc. 

Love is the most efficient way of bridging the gap and bringing together two separated souls.    

05. Recognition. Does the self even exist, in isolation? A big part of who we are is how others see us, how others respond to us, and how others relate to us. If we live in isolation, we never really become who we might have been, because the more developed part of human personality is probably formed in our relations to others. Love doesn't make us blind, it lets us see things we couldn't have seen before - parts of ourselves that were hitherto latent, hitherto unrealised. We probably crave relationships because there is a side of us that can only be accessed that way. When we do not nourish that part of ourselves there is always a lingering sense of our *missing something*, of a part of ourselves wilting and withering away - That we are somehow incomplete, or only half human.   

Rounded humans are humans who can tolerate or thrive during moments of solitude, but who can also form and forge meaningful connection with others when the moment is right. Either of those extremes is not healthy. Aloneness is probably necessary to find out who we really are, but relationships are often required *to become or to practise the reality of* who we are. You can be the most loving person in the world, but if there is no one to love...you can't be. You can be the most affectionate person by temperament, but if there is no one to hold and to snuggle with... you aren't. That part of yourself is a dead end. Many FAS (introverted people in general) are probably much more attuned to their underlying feelings, their wants, needs, etc, but much less capable of forming the relationships actually required to express or bring to life those things.   

I'm just thinking aloud here.  

The problem for older FAs I think is as follows: how do we obtain the benefits of relationships without having any realistic opportunity to enter relationships? The benefits would include - feeling that we have worth as people, that others ""recognise"" us, that we are ""seen"" and ""heard"", etc. That we have some sort of closeness and connection to the external world, or others in it, rather than feeling ourselves slipping toward a sense of isolation, or abandonment, etc? There are obviously ways to obtain traces of these things - friendship, volunteering, etc. - but I don't see how the heights of human intimacy can ever be obtained outside of a loving, intimate, relationship. That side of life is probably not reachable by any other road. There is a reason that people do not settle for friends, because friends do not fulfill the diversity and depth of need that people have to bond and belong. The life of the FA is probably a life forever on the margins.     

**""I want to be lonely no longer, but to learn again to be a human being. Here I have everything still to learn""** 

 Nietzsche 

 **‚Äú Man is alone because he is man! In some way every creature is alone. In majestic isolation every star travels through the darkness of endless space. Each tree grows according to its own law, fulfilling its unique possibilities. Animals live, fight and die for themselves alone, confined to the limitations of their bodies. Certainly, they also appear as male and female, in families and in flocks. Some of them are gregarious. But all of them are alone! Being alive means being in a body ‚Äî a body separated from all other bodies. And being separated means being alone.**

**This is true of every creature, and it is more true of man than of any other creature. He is not only alone; he also knows that he is alone. Aware of what he is, he asks the question of his aloneness. He asks why he is alone, and how he can triumph over his being alone. For this aloneness he cannot endure. Neither can he escape it. It is his destiny to be alone and to be aware of it. Not even God can take this destiny away from him....** **This is the greatness and this is the burden of man.""**

ForeverAlone,"Might as well just put it bluntly. Too many guys fantasise about their dream girl, or finding love, but you really have to step outside your mind and look at things objectively.

I‚Äôll be honest, I have been alone for my whole life up until now (24/M) I‚Äôve never been considered ugly. I was a late bloomer, I have a baby face and look like a teenager, but I realise what was holding me back wasn‚Äôt my looks (well for the most part) it was the fact I was depressed, anxious which made me a boring, unloveable person.

I would say I‚Äôm probably a 6, so I‚Äôm fortunate. I‚Äôve got a normie appearance but I‚Äôve not experienced relationships due to personal demons and I always thought it was my looks holding me back. But finally after years of loneliness, I‚Äôve met a girl and we are planning to meet tomorrow.

I‚Äôm not saying this to brag or rub salt in any wounds, I just have to be honest because I‚Äôve tasted the FA life without going into it too deep, so I sympathise for anyone 25+ who‚Äôs yet to find someone to love. I‚Äôm not out the woods yet, but my heart goes out to anyone who is generally considered unattractive, and have mental problems. I can see how those 2 together can prevent any type of relationship.

ForeverAlone,"A few days ago I got contacted by a hiring agency, 4 days after graduating, since they liked my profile. I never failed a year in college, did an internship abroad, and speak three European languages fluently (not showing off, I wouldn't be on this sub if I was *that* successful). On paper I was a good candidate for a really nice job/management traineeship at the HQ of a top 10 company in my country. Revenue over $10.5 billion and 30.000 employees. A really big firm, with lots of perks attached to the job. 

During the interview, I said at a certain moment that I'm a slightly introverted person in the beginning, but who becomes more extroverted once he gets to known his colleagues and team well. Which is true, and I think it's important to be honest. Besides, I specifically said 'slightly' introverted and that I DO have extroverted qualities. I also said I'm analytical, organizational and a good planner. They seemed to be interested still of who I am, but at the end of the one hour interview, they asked me if I could elaborate on the 'introvert' aspect. I immediately thought 'well, shit'. So, I kept on trying to say I'm introvert with extrovert qualities (seems like a bullshit answer, and it doesn't really make sense), but for some reason they still sent me the offer, but I could see and sense their diminishing interest. I know for sure that my chances to pass round two dropped by 90%. I personally also lost interest. Their reaction said it all. I can sense I won't be a fit with this firm, since they probably only hire extroverts. 

Despite my lost interest, it taught me two things. Honesty isn't that nice of a quality in the eyes of society. I should have lied about it, and introversion is a massive deformity in the eyes of an HR-person. We've talked for a fucking hour, and I said many things that don't sound that positive, like the fact that I'm good at speaking a certain language, but can't actually write it that well, or that I don't have any experience whatsoever, but they didn't care about that, since they liked my motivation. But the word 'introvert' echoed in their heads from the beginning until the end. 

I genuinely thought it wasn't that bad to mention it. Because even when doing student jobs, and my internship, they were always satisfied with my work. Former employers did mention my introversion, but said it's OK, since it doesn't actually disrupt my performance. On the contrary, sometimes it allows me to outperform the others since I'm able to focus well. But those weren't ""real"" jobs. It seems to be that the genuine non-school, non-student related world is harsher in judgment of your flaws. 

TLDR: I said during a job interview for a nice firm and function that I'm slightly introverted, and I saw their interest vanish in front of me, despite being the ideal candidate on paper. Society rewards extrovert liars, and honest introverts get fucked. 

Guys. You want a relationship? Just lie (a bit). Don't listen to people saying you have to be 100% genuine. Be 90% genuine, and bullshit 10% of your personality. That way you won't disappoint them, since you're still 90% real, and deliver the majority of what you promised, but you'll get miles ahead in life.","It's not just about romance, your traits that make you FA have an influence on almost every aspect of life",Vilain_XIIII

Today, she met up with him (for the first time in 3 months cause rona) and it seems like they are back together again. She posted a video of them both hugging and stuff. I honestly can‚Äôt tell if she‚Äôs with him again or what. I was about to ask her out but now I don‚Äôt know what to do. I asked her but she won‚Äôt be straight with me.

ForeverAlone,"so I've been trying to get into a social life again recently after being a shut-in for 5-6 years now, I'm 24years old btw. trying to accept invitations to go out from my coworkers etc ( I always denied these), trying dating apps, going out with my sister and her friends(all women I usually have huge social anxiety but im trying my best)..and posting stuff on my instagram.   


Now I just had a encounter 2days ago which still drives me mad thinking about this.  
On my insta I just had a simple mirror selfie as PP and 1 picture posted of myself.. and since my hobby is filmmaking/cinematics and I had a trip to japan a year ago with some footage I decided to cut it together for a little cinematic and post it, thought people might find it somewhat interesting.  
Now not a day later some dude comes up to me at work and asks very rudely like hes making fun of me in a kind of way why do I post it on insta and my instant reaction was ""because of my applications for a job"" and he laughed.. ? where the fuck does this guy get the audacity to ask me why I post this and that on my insta? It's the same as if someone comes up to you and asks you why you post a picture about yourself on your insta and I'm making that comparison because this is my hobby and I'ts what I'm doing most of my life so why would anyone ask this or am I just overexaggerating this, funny thing is this guy has photos of nightsky landscape with his shitty phone uploaded so can i ask him the same why does he post this stuff on insta how does it makes sense.   


I really feel like there's a barrier which is holding me back to ever get into social life again everytime I'm trying to get my shit together. It feels like people are putting themselves above you just because of your looks they think they're better and talk down on you in every situation and to be honest I'm seriously done if that's what mainly life is about, I'm pretty pissed writing this again and I cant pick my words right im sorry and english is not my main language. similar situations like this happened so often now, every time i tried to fucking live my pathetic life and get shit going

ForeverAlone,"Ot happened again today .. as I left work and went to the train station I saw her infront of me , immediatly I turned around and went into the other direction hoping that she didnt see me as our eyes didnt lock this time. After I came back home I recieved a message from her ""thanks for saying hi"" it made me feel like shit.

I had a really complicated relationship with her .. during uni we both had a crush on each other and kept unconciously flurting .. even my friend said  just ask her out already but since i was a wuss and never asked someone out before I chickened out.
On my graduation day I gathered my courage and asked her out and she said yes .. that was the happiest day of my life since at the end od our date I told her how I felt and she (I assume) played shocked she did say she also had a crush on me but still said she needed time to think ... couple of days later she rejected me .. I felt manipulated since her reasons made no sense.

ForeverAlone,"So I've been crushing on this girl from my college for a while (almost a year now) messaging her on and off. She is also quiet and kind of socially awkward and introverted, so I was interested in her. I told her I have a crush on her and nothing really happened. She messages me once in a while. Deep down I knew it was hopeless but it at least made me feel like I was doing something....you know?

So tonight my friend/neighbour invited me to a small party/get-together of just 4 people and my crush happened to be there. I mustered all my courage and managed to show up (I have mild social anxiety)
So basically my crush was talking to her friend about all the guys she thinks are hot and who she has a crush on. Including some of our professors.  And how ugly guys suck. I was sitting right next to her and she knows I have a crush on her. I dunno.. it just made me realize how invisible I am. She never even considered me as an option. And here I was crushing on her for almost a year. 

It just seems like this endless cycle of crushing on someone, then getting crushed...I know I shouldn't get upset.. I wish I could be like everyone else... Why was I born like this.. I just want someone to care, even a little bit..

 I don't know whether to hate myself or to hate everyone around me. Do you FA guys even exist IRL? Why is it that I can never relate to anyone I talk to.. I don't even know what I'm saying anymore.

Over the last few nights, I‚Äôve decided to frame my musings a little differently. Instead of just randomly thinking about person after person, I‚Äôve started to play FMK. Amongst the myriad of ‚ÄúNo,‚Äù I‚Äôve received over my lifetime, I can break them up into various categories:

Of the women who outright rejected me, who would I FMK? Of the women that I didn‚Äôt pursue because they were involved with someone else, who would I FMK? Of the women flirted with me just to hook up with someone else, who would I FMK? Of the women who went on a date or two with me then ghosted next, who would I FMK? (You get the idea.)

ForeverAlone,"So like a lot of you, I've been alone and lonely for a long time. I'm 29 now. I've had one dating experience back in college that last about a month until she realized how unfulfilling I was making her life.

Also like a lot of you, I'm craving intimacy, to the point where it hurts thinking about it. Recently I've met someone on Reddit, a guy, and we got along great. It was really nice to have someone to talk to about random things.

We've talked for about a month now and I share a lot of personal things with him. Turns out he lives about 2 hours away from me.

Here's where things get weird.

We were talking last week about relationships and stuff, and he tells me he's gay. I had no idea about this at all during the time we talked previously. It kind of came out of the blue and on top of that, he told me he liked me. He knows that I'm straight but he still said this (paraphrasing):

""I know you're not into guys but I just have to let you know that I've fallen for you. Sorry if this changes things between us.""

Well I was flattered but I told him it wouldn't change anything and that he was brave for telling me. 

Fast forward to last night.

I'd been telling him that I'd been feeling very lonely and wanting to have sex and stuff. We talked about this stuff before he confessed so I thought it would be okay to mention that.

He offered to give me a blowjob and cuddle me when lockdown is over.

I haven't replied to him yet as I wanted to get opinions from you guys. What would you do?

On one hand, I'm definitely not gay so it would be really weird for me, but on the other hand... I'm pretty desperate. Getting a blowjob, even from a guy, would probably feel amazing and cuddling would be amazing too.

ForeverAlone,"I'd like to think of myself as worthwhile. I'd like to think I have unique and varied tastes in movies, music, TV shows, etc. Yeah, I'm a geek who enjoys videogames, comic books, and cheesey Horror movies, so of course I'm somewhat socially awkward and am not the type of guy who is going to enjoy talking about Sports, tools, cars, hunting, or any other stereotypical ""guy things,"" but that doesn't mean I'm some kinda spineless nobody. Plenty of people tend to be really into Geek culture, it's just that most of them appear to be almost half my age.

I do live in an area of Michigan that has always been a bit more Conservative or religious, but the area is growing and there certainly seems to be a thriving culture of more Progressively-minded folks in town. Again, I'm socially awkward, so I don't get out much. Besides, I'm not sure where I'd find these people, even more so now with a pandemic keeping everything closed.

Yes, I find Trump abhorrent and disgraceful, but so do many of the women I see on dating apps. I see more anti-Trump statements in dating profiles than I see women in pink MAGA hats. I also am aware that plenty of women have no interest in having kids, so my own childfree outlook isn't that unusual.

I can think of plenty of reasons why I probably shouldn't bother with dating. Most of these reasons are just excuses prompted by depression and anxiety. I have incredibly low self-esteem and I always feel unbelievably inadequate around others. I can list off a hundred reasons why I can envision my life ending in suicide and I know I'm not the only one to have such feelings. I also know not to let these feelings control my life, that I have to be the one to make an effort to change.

However, as I have mentioned, I have no god damn idea how or where I can meet people that I will be able to connect with. I was never one for the bar/club scene and most of those places are still closed or are typically full of younger people. I wouldn't turn down the legit interest from a gal in her mid/late 20s, but I think that ship has sailed. Being 41 means I'm finding less women who are not only single, but also less likely to have much in common with me. It's hard enough to know who a person is right off the bat, but if you're like me and struggle with striking up conversations with strangers, you're more likely to just avoid being around people you don't know, in hopes of avoiding awkward and pointless chit chat.

So, I've tried dozens of dating apps. None of them yield anything. Even the more niche apps, like TasteBuds.FM, High There, Geek2Geek, or Agnostic.com that are meant to use specific tastes, interests, or values as a starting off point fail to pay off. Mostly because these more focused apps barely have anyone on them and because most of them seem to require payment in order to communicate. I can like/swipe right/thumbs up/etc every even slightly-appealing profile I see and I still get no responses. Again, it also seems like the women who seem to be the most enticing are either too young or almost always live more than an hour away.

I can't meet people IRL if my life depended on it and trying to do so online ends in me losing money as well as confidence.

ForeverAlone," They say dating is a numbers game so iv'e been thinking, why not attempt to calculate my odds of getting a date off of Tinder? That way, I can get an estimate of how many girls I need to swipe on before being able to get a date. I'm bored, nerdy, and clearly have nothing better to do so why not? So with that said, here's my attempt at calculating my odds.

I have many things going for me in life, looking like a male model isn't one of them. With that said, judging by my less than stellar appearance, i'm going to guess that I would probably get around a 1% match rate assuming that I swipe yes on almost every single girl that I encounter. This means for every 10,000 girls, I should match with around 100 of them. Not bad for a simpleton like me.

BUT out of these 100 girls, half of them are bots, trannies, or women I would never be attracted to so realistically, i'm only going to go on a date with half of them. This leaves me with 50 girls left out of 10,000 to shoot my shot with.

Now let's just assume for every girl that I message, iv'e got a 10% chance of actually meeting up with her. That means out of 50 girls, I wind up going on a date with 5 of them. Now take 10,000 divided by 5 and that equals 2000.

That way, I can get an estimate of how many girls I need to swipe on before being able to get a date.   I'm bored, nerdy, and clearly have nothing better to do so why not? So with that said, here's my attempt at calculating my odds. 

I have many things going for me in life, looking like a male model isn't one of them. With that said, judging by my less than stellar appearance, i'm going to guess that I would probably get around a 1% match rate assuming that I  swipe yes on almost every single girl that I encounter.  This means for every 10,000 girls, I should match with around 100 of them. Not bad for a simpleton like me. 

BUT out of these 100 girls, half of them are bots, trannies, or women I would never be attracted to so realistically, i'm only going to go on a date with half of them. This leaves me with 50 girls left out of 10,000 to shoot my shot with. 

Now let's just assume for every girl that I message, iv'e got a 10% chance of actually meeting up with her. That means out of 50 girls, I wind up going on a date with 5 of them. Now take 10,000 divided by 5 and that equals 2000.

ForeverAlone,"  

I don't know why I wrote this or why I want to share it.

I don‚Äôt even know if this belongs here but here it goes anyway. 

I'm 23. I'm fairly young but I'm sure I'll end up alone despite everything I believed about myself.

I'm not ugly at all or horrible company but I've been fucked over so many times that it lead to this mess of a person and I can't do it anymore. 

Let's start at the beginning, in school, I got teased a lot and then more by my distant family. my direct family has never caused me harm with the few comments here and there from my sister.

I ended up growing up and in their words '' I had a glow up '' and suddenly everyone was so much nicer to me. I went from not picking up any attention to getting compliments all the time, having random guys flirt with me and I thought ""Hey, maybe there's hope for me?''

I wanted the compliments and attention to continue so I started putting so much of my self-worth and value on how I looked, dressed, and presented myself to the world. over-analyzing every picture every inch of my face and body.

When I was 18 was the first time a guy ever made a move on me and asked me out, I was studying Engineering at university and we were in the same major with the same classes, this was the beginning of it all when I finally felt worthy enough of getting attention. this was "" IT"" for me, hey I grew up I'm no longer the weird kid in school.

And then he tried to rape me.

It took me a while to finally wrap my head around what happened and how I got away from it. It took me years to tell people close to me and the first things I heard whenever I'd share that were:

"" You're really pretty so I'm not surprised someone tried to do that""

"" At least you got away, does it matter if he didn't really do it ?""

"" I wouldn't focus on that too much, just forget about it""

So I just tried my best to not think of it and drown out the noise, I went through a long phase of wearing really baggy clothes and panic attacks when anyone would try to touch me.

It didn't help that he was still there in my classes and I'd see him on campus, I'd see the way he and his friends looked at me and the way people looked at me. The whispers and the giggles...

The first person I ever told is an ex-best friend who told me to ""put myself out there and it'll help me feel better""

So to lack of better judgment and experience; I did.

I'm gonna spare you the boring details and tell you none of them worked. (They're all months apart)

1. Initially, I met a guy who seemed nice, it took me a minute to get used to the whole thing again and I thought maybe I just had a really bad first try but the more time I spent with him the more I saw he was emotionally abusive (I didn't really understand emotional abuse at the time but something felt off), he ended up cheating on me and things ended there.

2. After that, I dated a guy who again seemed so fucking nice and I mean this guy was someone everyone thought was a sweetheart but he was such a manipulative fuck who stalked me and made me feel so unsafe. I took the time to build up the courage to break up with him and had to deal with him harassing my friends on social media and showing up to places I'd go to and my university. I had to get a restraining order.

3. The last guy I dated, the one that lasted the longest. We dated for about a year and a half and it was different. He was nice, loving, sweet and so considerate and I thought ""He's the one!"" but it wasn't until a year in that we started having trouble and disagreeing. His relationship with the bottle was better than ours at that point. Then there it was; he'd get drunk, do things and then ""apologize"" "" I didn't mean it, I was just drunk"". It took me a long time to build up courage and break things off.

I live in a small town, a small country and people talk. I know what they think of me and the things they say but the truth is so far from it all.

I left Engineering 3 years in with a year to graduation because I kept getting harassed everywhere I go by my colleagues, by people on-site and I know ""why don't you report"" (not to mention I didn't like the major or the field much after everything that has happened.)

I live in a place where it doesn't fucking matter cause everyone knows each other and to them "" he wouldn't do that""

I'm not weak, I don't look at myself like that but I just feel suffocated.

I'm currently 23 years old studying IT at another university. starting again, looking for hope but I don't see it. 

What's the point?

ForeverAlone,"It‚Äôs become a stagnating cycle of disinterest for me. I go to work every day, deal with the same annoyances every day, and come home to sit alone and wonder what my life could be.

I have a small circle of close friends. They care about me and are there for me. But the most they can do is offer advice, none of them can fill this void where affection should be. What happens to men like me when we die? What will my life be worth and what has it been worth so far?

It's the sad realization that this is how it's going to be for a very long time.

It's the emptiness in the heart. It's depression. It's a void.

It hurts.",Less of a human being. . .,I_EXlST
ForeverAlone,"She asked for it, I was hesitant as I hadn't posted or gone on it for over a year and my profile is pretty much an absolute shitshow of sorts. Plus there was the fact she hadn't seen what I looked like at that point... hence the reason why I'm sure she asked for it. It feels like I took my shot and failed. I deleted some posts that were straight up embarrassing but I think the damage has been done. I think a large part of why she was flirty with me a lot and it felt like it was progressing well is because she didn't know what I looked like back then as sad as that sounds. She was probably conjuring up some handsome man in her head because lord knows I don't look like Brad Pitt.

Now she never signs off with flirty messages like she used to, or sometimes doesn't say anything at all. Just goes offline. That's nice. One word answers and absolutely dead conversations. I've lost this one boys.

I've never got this far with the opposite sex, it was a valiant attempt. Shame, I really liked this girl and thought something magical was happening =/

ForeverAlone,"I (29M) have always struggled with dating and it's gotten even tougher these last few months. Not only can I barely strike up a conversation, but if a girl does respond to me, how the fuck are we supposed to date while also socially distancing? Not that I've met up with any of my online matches in over 2 years, but still....how TF are people finding SO's in this world we're in right now? I feel like I have no one to talk to about this crushing loneliness that has been growing and growing for 29 years.

I've never had a girlfriend and even the short flings I've had didn't seem to have any substance. I just want someone in my life that I want to spend time with, to open up to, to love, and to be loved by. 

The worst part is that I'm not totally alone. I'm a decent looking man with his shit mostly together who has friends in his life. However, these people who are in my life make me feel more isolated and more alone than if I had no one around me. It feels like there is any empty void where my heart should be and it's growing day by day. It hurts too. It really fucking hurts and I feel more lost and isolated than ever.

ForeverAlone,"There's a strong correlation but, one thing I've found, is that you can be attractive in terms of having aesthetically pleasing features and a well proportioned, lean body and still women won't find you sexually attractive. There are exceptions like many young actors and singers who get female attention due to their aestheticness despite not being ""manly"", but they're rich and famous in addition. For those of us not famous, Women might consider you for some future hypothetical relationship because she thinks she should be attracted to you. But she still isn't. You derive as much sexual excitement in her as a banana might.

\- Arthur Schopenhauer",Aesthetic Attractiveness Isn't The Same as Sexual Attractiveness,jametrin22
ForeverAlone,"Everything society tells you you need to do or need to be in order to be considered worthy of love and affection is bullshit. No amount of success or self improvement will actually make someone sexually attracted to you. Sexual attraction doesn't care if you're a good, honest person. Sexual attraction is amoral.

I'm aware this is going to come off as a douchey humble brag, but I have to get my point across. Apart from the disaster that is my dating life, I've got every other aspect of my life pretty much in order. I'm college educated, I have a prestigious, well playing job, I'm very well-off financially, I work out 5 days a week and I have a lean body, I don't smoke or drink, I'm well-read, I have plenty of hobbies, I meditate daily. I'm not done with my self improvement journey, but I've gotten further than I ever thought I could, and I'm only 25. However, I am neither happy, nor fulfilled.

All my attempts to date or otherwise form a meaningful connection with a woman have failed miserably. It's not like I've been sitting with my hands in my pockets the whole time, waiting for a relationship to magically fall in my lap. I've been on the apps since 2015, I've approached women in clubs, I've asked out girls from my college groups etc. I'm no stranger to rejection, ghosting, flaking and getting stood up. 

For the longest time I thought that I was just socially inept, that I was somehow uniquely flawed and that something must be very wrong with me. I was completely oblivious to the fact that male sexlessness is a global phenomenon now. Every time I got ghosted or flaked on I'd obsess over every little thing I said, asking myself where it all went wrong, what wrong thing I said that could have possibly sent creepy vibes? Did I come on too strong, or was I too boring? Did I ask her out too late, or too soon? Did I sound needy, or too nonchalant? I kept gaslighting myself instead of thinking outside the box.

I started reading a ton of books and other material on dating, social intelligence, seduction and relationships. I've learned a lot of interesting, eye-opening things and put in an insane amount of effort, but with zero results. I'm just tired. Very, very tired, and totally ready to throw in the towel. I don't know how much longer I can repeat the same cycle over and over again: match with girl, talk with girl, ask her on a date, she accepts, and then either ghosts me or comes up with some bullshit excuse one hour before the date. When a girl agrees to meet me, I don't even get my hopes up anymore. I got ghosted at least a dozen times in 2020 alone, and it feels dehumanizing, like you're just a commodity in a meat market, ready to be discarded the instant something better comes along. I think dating apps and social media has completely brainwashed us for good. People forget that at the other end of their phone there's a human being with feelings, not just some pictures and words on a screen.

As a caveat, I don't hate women and I never have.  I'd say the only negative emotion I've ever felt towards them is envy - envious of their priviledge when it comes to sex, dating, relationships, even friendships, but also envious of their blissful ignorance towards the male experience. Someone else on reddit made a perfect analogy of this: Imagine you're a farmer tending to his fields. A woman is blessed with an endlessly fertile soil with lots of rain, where crops are always growing. Most turn out to be bad, some are good. At the end of the day, chances are she'll get a good harvest, and even if she gets many bad crops in a row, the opportunity to get a good one is always there. Being a man, on the other hand, is like trying to grow crops in the fucking Sahara desert. You can be the most skilled and hard-working farmer in the world, all you'll get is sand and scorpions.

What's the point of this post? Don't chase success, status, money, knowledge, in hopes that will help you find love. And most importantly, don't ask reddit for dating advice, you'll always be met with the same gaslighting garbage: ""IMPROVE YOURSELF BRO"", in other words, ""you are not X enough to be worthy of love and affection. Go try harder.""","You can ""have it all"" and still end up FA",Nomaaaad

ForeverAlone,"This is my first time venting here but I think it would be more like talking about how I became the way I am right now. I grew up in a somewhat dysfunctional family, my father was a workaholic and my mother was a mentally unstable woman who constantly abused me verbally and emotionally. As a little kid I was very talkative and cheerful but slowly all the abuse I got from my mom and all the bullying I faced in school ( mainly for being fat) started to take a toll on my mental health. I had few friends in primary school who were into nerdy things like Star Wars, Anime and etc. However, I lost them once I was transferred to another school. I didn‚Äôt have any friends from the beginning of middle school until the senior years of high school. I was regularly bullied for being quirky and awkward. My life was pretty monotonous, I went to school everyday and then came back home, did homework, watched anime or played video games or surfed on the web for hours. In high school I started to develop depression. I looked like a stereotypical nerd that you would see in American cartoons/ shows with glasses, braces and acne on my face. College was a bit different, I made a lot of friends but slowly all of them drifted away. I‚Äôm currently 21 years old single, kissless virgin. I‚Äôm suffering from mild depression, social anxiety, ADHD, hypochondria and porn addiction . I don‚Äôt know if I can be considered an FA cuz I have never tried dating. I consider myself to be unromantic or aromantic ( don‚Äôt know which one is the right term). I have never fallen In love, I was only infatuated with a girl in high school to whom I never confessed my feelings. Honestly I don‚Äôt believe in romantic love And things related to romance just seem cheesy to me (no offence) . Personality-wise I used to be a People pleaser and a lot of people took advantage of that but later I matured and learned to demand respect from other people.

If I shaved my stubble, grew my hair long and did make-up I would look like a real woman Lol.  Another thing that makes me avoid dating is my lack of experience. I don‚Äôt know how to flirt and read signs. And I don‚Äôt think I would have sex with someone even when opportunity came, I‚Äôm scared that I wouldn‚Äôt know how to properly engage in bed despite watching thousands of porn videos. I‚Äôve tried to hire prostitutes but in the end I would have panic-attack and change my mind. And i‚Äôm also extremely self-conscious about my body and feel embarrassed being naked in front of someone.

So your best bet is to meet people in person and show them other endearing qualities that can compensate for your lack of aesthetics.

If you have social anxiety, you struggle, and are even fearful, when it comes to social interactions. It's hard to put yourself out there because the fear of being judged stops you from going out and having a good time. You either stay away from those interactions all together, or you give off a nervous energy that everyone picks up on when you do decide to muster enough courage to go out.

ForeverAlone,"Some background: I'm not new to relationships and about 4 years ago I was with a girl for a year or so, but we weren't able to make it work since we lived too far away. Kinda an unfortunate scenario for the time. I haven't thought about or had any desire to date until this past year.

I talked to one girl who was my friend for 2 years prior, but she ghosted me after our second date and neglected the fact we even dated. She kinda just dated me out of pity, since we were friends. I honestly feel bad for being so ignorant to the situation and not realizing that she genuinely did not want to date me.

When I started talking to the next girl I thought we connected on another level. Whenever we talked we always understood each other and I thought we clicked really well. I ended up asking her out on a date and she seemed excited and said to message her to plan it out later. When I messaged her, she ghosted me for 2 weeks without a sorry or any explanation. Idk, I guess I wasn't really worth her time.

When I talked to the next girl it was really fuckin' sick cause we liked talking with each other, we found each other really attractive, and I we had a lot in common. However I found out that she had like 15-20 fuckbuddys and was looking for another one to add to her list (only valued me physically). I'm not interested in someone who doesn't value me personally. She knew I wanted something serious and kinda led me on the entire time we were talking, so I dipped.

This last girl really kinda fucked me up tho. I started talking to her and everything was going great, pretty much all the good things from the above girls combined. Our interests aligned, when we talked it was always a good time and we related a lot from how our past relationships have gone. She ended up telling me she was moving in 3 or 4 months, but made it seem like we could still go for a relationship. I tried planning a date, but she ended up postponing it 2 times. On my 3rd time trying to plan it she told me she was emotionally unavailable and not ready for a relationship. Despite that tho, a week or so later she ends up complaining about how her love life ""is complete garbage"" and that ""all guys are suck"". Idk, I guess I never thought I was 'that bad'.

I don't want to self-loathe a whole lot, but it really hurts seeing how meaningless I am to someone. I always get attached way too fast and always end up feeling a lot more sad because of it. I gotta work on myself a bunch because this isn't 'unlucky', and I truly believe that I am extremely flawed some way or another. Even with that tho, my self esteem has lowered so much from dating and it's honestly getting harder to put myself out there especially when I feel like I'm a burden to these peeps and unwanted by everyone I meet.","Dating kinda sucks, or maybe I kinda suck",Tricky0000
ForeverAlone,"Every time i ask for advice on how to get a girlfriend, i get the same shit a lot of you guys have probably heard, 

""Its cause you have no hobbies!"" (I have tons of hobbies) 

""Its cause you dont have a job!"" (I just quit my job, for a newer higher paying one, i start today, and am very scared tbh so i havent slept all night) 

""Its cause you dont shower!!!!!!!!"" (shower daily)

""Its cause your awful PerSonAlLITYYY!!!!11!"" - 

I met a girl once, she was extremely attractive, but she was using me.... she was a master manipulator, she was using everyone she surrounds herself by, and was obsessed with sex. 

She had a boyfriend who lived out of state and was using me to get her stuff that i wont mention, just know she was using me and it was confirmed. Every time any even remotely attractive male started at the work place, shed go try to fuck him. Her boyfriend would constantly ask her if she was cheating on him, shed just lie, and lie to him.... Whenever i bring this up on dating subs when they bring up ""personality"" they just scream and REEEEEEE about how women fuck who they want... when they want.... which is the problem with this girl. 

She was leading on about 3 different dudes all at once, including me. A lot of men can see through it and use her for sex and discard her, but im a lonely virgin who has never had any friends or girlfriends so the fact and girl was even giving me attention was a surprise, me and her never had sex, but she was my first kiss. 

There was times where id try to cut her off, because i just saw how she was using her BF and using other men, going around ""doing what she wants when she wants."" I even called her out on that shit, and she just says ""I can fuck whoever i want."" all.... while having a bf.... who is clueless....

This honestly gave me a bad taste in my mouth for anyone who defends that behavior, when on reddit someone says something similar to her, i literally just feel sick. 

Thing is she was a beautiful young girl, and eventually she ended up getting pregnant, and... ig its her bfs kid? but who knows.... she than cut me off. finally. I feel sorry for the guy she was dating... he had the gut instinct she was being horrible, and he was right. shed joke about it ""haha im such a bad girlfriend but MEH!"" horrible, just horrible. 

But it made me realize personality.... it means nothing. It really doesnt, her personality... the way she was as a person, was evil, and shit, yet she would never be alone like me. Because she was attractive, and thats all it takes, is to be attractive, and you will receive all the attention you desire.

I go to alot of anime conventions and ive always been rejected in every way shape or form. My friends are able to get the attention of cute cosplay girls asking them for pictures its just really depressing after having to deal with all of this constantly for a good 10 years.

So I posted my photos on here. Only 4 people commented. All of them told me I'd look good if I changed this and changed that, but they never said how  I looked in those photos. So that basically meant I'm ugly. It killed my confidence even more when the rest of people on that subs usually get at least one compliment, but I got none.

ForeverAlone,"I don't know why I made this throw away account or why I want to share this.

I'm 23. I'm fairly young but I'm sure I'll end up alone despite everything I believed about myself. 

I'm not ugly at all or horrible company but I've been fucked over so many times that it has lead to this mess of a person and I can't do it anymore. 

Let's start at the beginning, in school, I got teased a lot and then more by my distant family. my direct family has never caused me harm with the few comments here and there from my sister.

I ended up growing up and in their words '' I had a glow up '' and suddenly everyone was so much nicer to me. I went from not picking up any attention to getting compliments all the time, having random guys flirt with me and I thought ""Hey, maybe there's hope for me?''

When I was 18 was the first time a guy ever made a move on me and asked me out, I was studying Engineering at university and we were in the same major with the same classes, this was the beginning of it all when I finally felt worthy enough of getting attention. this was "" IT"" for me, hey I grew up I'm no longer the weird kid in school.

And then he tried to rape me. 

It took me a while to finally wrap my head around what happened and how I got away from it. It took me years to tell people close to me and the first things I heard whenever I'd share that were: 

"" You're really pretty so I'm not surprised someone tried to do that""

"" At least you got away, does it matter if he didn't really do it ?""

"" I wouldn't focus on that too much, just forget about  it""

So I just tried my best to not think of it and drown out the noise, I went through a long phase of wearing really baggy clothes and panic attacks when anyone would try to touch me.

It didn't help that he was still there in my classes and I'd see him on campus, I'd see the way he and his friends looked at me and the way people looked at me. The whispers and the giggles... 

The first person I ever told is an ex-best friend who told me to ""put myself out there and it'll help me feel better""

So to lack of better judgment and experience; I did. 

I'm gonna spare you the boring details and tell you none of them worked. (They're all months apart)

1. Initially, I met a guy who seemed nice, it took me a minute to get used to the whole thing again and I thought maybe I just had a really bad first try but the more time I spent with him the more I saw he was emotionally abusive (I didn't really understand emotional abuse at the time but something felt off), he ended up cheating on me and things ended there.
2. After that, I dated a guy who again seemed so fucking nice and I mean this guy was someone everyone thought was a sweetheart but he was such a manipulative fuck who stalked me and made me feel so unsafe. I broke up with him and had to deal with him harassing my friends on social media and showing up to places I'd go to and my university. I had to get a restraining order.
3. The last guy I dated, the one that lasted the longest. We dated for about a year and a half and it was different. He was nice, loving, sweet and so considerate and I thought ""He's the one!"" but it wasn't until a year in that we started having trouble and disagreeing. His relationship with the bottle was better than ours at that point. Then there it was; he'd get drunk, do things and then ""apologize"" "" I didn't mean it, I was just drunk"". It took me a long time to build up courage and break things off.

I live in a small town, a small country and people talk. I know what they think of me and the things they say but the truth is so different.

I left Engineering 3 years in with a year to graduation because I kept getting harassed everywhere I go by my colleagues, by people on-site and I know ""why don't you report"" not to mention I didn't like the major or the field much after everything that has happened.

I live in a place where it doesn't fucking matter cause everyone knows each other and to them "" he wouldn't do that""

I'm not weak, I don't look at myself like that but I just feel suffocated.

I'm currently 23 years old studying IT at another university. starting again, looking for hope but I don't see it.

Some examples... 

The valedictorian of my class went to Harvard and is now a lawyer at a fancy law firm.

The weird fat kid that would wear ICP hoodies everyday is still a weird fat guy. Although I haven't seen an ICP related Facebook post in years.

The jock guy that was super macho and played football and wrestling is still super hot and posts tons of shirt pics of him doing crossfit on Instagram.

My brother's friend that was a gigantic comicbook/anime type fat nerd guy. He's still a fat comicbook nerd. Although he did manage to get get married, which was shocking to me, and has some sort of financial job making good money, but he was pretty smart, so not unexpected.

One of my sisters friends sold pot in highschool, then became a pretty serious drug dealer after high school, got arrested, and went to prison for several years. When he got out of prison he totally turned his life around. He has some sort of HVAC job and is married with a kid... That's an actual change, but I'm going to put it under the getting off of drugs category.

ForeverAlone,"A few years ago I went to my school prom by myself. I had asked one girl if she would go with me and she respectfully declined which is better than what I usually get. A couple days later I decided since I bought the tux I would go to prom by myself. I went and was there for a little while maybe an hour. I saw the girl I asked to prom with another guy which I didnt really care because I figured that was why she didnt accept my invitation. So I sat at a table by myself for about another ten minutes until the girl I saw earlier sat at the same table. She called me a creep for coming to prom by myself which I dont know how that makes me a creep. She made such a racket that everybody started to stare at us, at that point I got up and left. 

It sounds silly but being called a creep just for being single isnt how I expected to spend my first and last prom night.

In January, I had my first hug then kiss with a girl I thought I liked. In actuality, I didn't like her, I was simply horny and I let my guard down. luckily I didn't go any further with her and called things off. I now feel like an outsider here compared to most others who frequent this sub. But I feel like this gives me a unique opportunity to spread a message that I didn't know of before and I know not many people on this sub know either.

**Do not go after women.**

This may be quite controversial and unpopular, I know many people on here who hate themselves for not being able to be or talk with women, but nothing gets better If you somehow find a women who will tolerate you like I did. Note the word ""tolerate"" because that is all that happens, you tolerate them; they tolerate you.

You may be thinking that you are depressed now since you don't have any luck with women. I don't doubt that. I was the same. I cried at night thinking that I would never get a girlfriend, that I would die a virgin. If the pain I felt one especially lonely night was a 10, the pain and dread I felt the night after the kiss was a 20. I regretted it wholly, I hate myself for it and I honestly wanted to die that night. I thought that was what I had wanted out of life, It turns out it wasn't. It ruined me. I regret it every day to the point where I never want to be with a woman again since I don't want to feel like that again.

Consider this my warning to anybody out there who feels like I did, that all they want is a kiss and a relationship. 

**You don't, It will ruin you like It ruined me**  

Please, focus on yourself and your own happiness, buy a body pillow and a fleshligh, they will make you happy, women won't.

You can't have any other type of or a deep conversation with me because i'm generally very bad with communicating my thoughts and i'm not receptive of the other person at all. Like if something really awful happened to someone and they told me about it, you could count on me not feeling any compassion or empathy (if said thing would not be bad to me, and it likely wouldn't) and i'd be like ""mmhh"" at most. I'm completely unable to help anyone with anything, be it emotional support or something or something else where you need to do thinking or something physical i don't know. Come to think of it, i literally can not think of any occasion ever where i contributed to someone's life in a positive way or where i made someone genuinely feel better through words or actions.

If you met me you might not even immediately recognize it, but i'm probably the most self-centered person you could possibly imagine.

Thats kinda besides the point though. The main thing is, anytime this dude is away from her, she decides to spend every second she can with me.

I think I was actually going through one of the best times in my life since high school. I was feeling so good, I decided what the hell, I'll message a girl in my Zoom class since I know she plays games. To my surprise, she actually responded. Holy shit, maybe I won't be by myself anymore. From there on, we ended up playing games and talking with each other every day. I thought that this was it. I'm not going to be alone anymore. I knew that I had just been unlucky up till this point and it was just a matter of time before I had a girl of my own.

But now I'm just sitting here alone in my room again. That same girl that used to message me back instantly now takes hours to even respond. She's busy now with a guy that is just better than me. I was there at a time when she needed the company the most. And I'm glad that I could be there for her even if she isn't interested in me anymore. I'm glad that I could share my favorite games with her and watch my favorite TV shows and movies with her.

ForeverAlone,"It wasn't long ago, I was BLK pilled in March, which was my last ""rejection"" as one of my friends just made up excuses instead of actually saying ""no"". At this point, my experience with trying to date women was to no avail. I wanted a relationship, a companionship, intimacy, someone to love and care for me, someone to just cuddle with and it seemed everybody was experienced in having these things, and I tied my self worth to what women thought of me. I've done everything from buying food, to completing their coding projects to helping them out with assignments just to receive some kind of appreciation. I was offended every time a girl wouldn't follow me back on my instagram(toxic, I know).

 I was already depressed for a few years because I honestly thought I was good at nothing in my life. My educational career was shit, my dating life was nonexistent, and I didn't have friends that I could consider close. My counselors in school recommended me to get an ADHD screening, but my parents swept it under the rug. It made me think that my parents don't care about me, they kept labeling me as lazy, and I was convinced that I was just lazy. Fast forward to college, and despite my burning desire to succeed and trying my best, I ended up with a 1.8 GPA in my first year. I also tied my self worth to my grades, but I lied about them to my parents and this damaged how I look at myself overall. 

In order to cope with these emotions, I dove straight into the depths of reddit. I found this subreddit, and a bunch of other incel ones. These were all people whom I could relate to, people that understood my pain. I realized that I started to indulge my thoughts in hatred. I started hating myself for being so inefficient; I hated couples; I hated my friends who are so successful that I developed an inferiority complex; I hated attractive men and women because of how easily their existence got validated; I hated girls that rejected me in the past because how they used and disposed of me. This was a never ending cycle of hatred that I continued to put myself through, to the point where suicide became comforting.

Finally, I reached a breaking point. I actually met someone on reddit who was willing to let me vent to her. She was someone I could relate to, and she made me ask myself ""why was I doing nice things for people in order to get something in return?"". What many people who are ""forever alone"" do is continue to base their worth to what other people think, yet not make any self improvements or improving their self-image. I felt that I was one of the few people that continued look for ways to improve, whereas people in these forums/subreddits always seemed to perpetuate their self destructive behavior. Yes I became relatively fit because I wanted to attract girls, I am not socially inept, I like getting drunk and going to parties, I can be extroverted sometimes, my friends think I'm funny, all of this despite me being ""ugly"". But then I just thought to myself, ""what if I stopped basing my self-worth on what other people think?"", cliche I know......But I know there are some people, despite such adversities, are successful. I know short unattractive dudes that have had MULTIPLE girlfriends before, I know people that looked like the ""typical incel"" and have made a complete 180 (from working out) just because he had a change in perspective. 

From extensive research from reading articles and my own experiences (i do have some female friends), my experience with dating GOES BOTH WAYS FOR MEN AND WOMEN. There are TONS of men that also talk about how attractive/unattractive the women they know in their life are. I am personally guilty of it as well. No, I am not blue pilled, still BLK pilled because I believe women do have more options, but some keep making the mistake of looking in the wrong places, regardless of their appearance. However, this world is full of creeps that make women uncomfortable, and are often subjects of abuse from entitled men. MEN, YOU ARE NOT ENTITLED TO A WOMAN JUST BECAUSE SHE'S NICE TO YOU AND YOU DO NICE THINGS FOR HER. I think sometimes, guys forget about struggles women face, and invalidate their issues because our issues are ""worse"". No, I saw some of the creepiest and disturbing messages my female friends and my cousins have received. It doesn't feel good to be only sexualized, and falsely validated just because you're a woman.

I am essentially regurgitating what I have learned:  but guys, women are just people like us. Stop doing things for them in order to get something in return. Put a lot of effort into something productive which you can develop an interest for (I personally like coding, trading, art, etc). Actually become friends with women, like platonically instead of pursuing them romantically, because they can give you way more valuable advice. If you do end up liking someone, go in with minimal expectations and don't try to force it. Workout, get a haircut, buy fresh clothes, and most importantly make progress on other aspects of your life. No one is going to care what you look like if you're an excellent programmer, artist, photographer, chef, day trader, freelance developer, etc...Because its your skills that do the talking.

As a 20 year old virgin, I am gonna take my own advice here and embark on my journey to ascension. Love and companionship might be one of the major components of happiness to most people, but I am gonna try to improve my self-image and my self-confidence. How YOU VIEW YOURSELF and DOING WHAT MAKES YOU HAPPY should be the biggest source of happiness which overshadows love. I am gonna start by having an open discussion about my learning disability with my parents, and start working out.

ForeverAlone,"This is somewhat of a follow-up post from the one I made six days ago. To recap, I met a girl in a popular PC game that I play and after playing a few games together and some casual chatting, she sends me a friend request on Discord. I have been talking with her for over a week now. Sometimes she initiates the conversation and other times, I do. It turned out that she was/is struggling with some mental health problems and having faced some of that myself, it was a nice feeling having someone to talk to who I could relate with. I find her to be an interesting person and we have sent some pictures to each other, (only of our pets and where we live so far though) and I won't lie that a part of me being attracted to her is due to the fact she looks absolutely gorgeous in her profile picture. We have talked as late into the very early morning sometimes.

We know each other's first names and other stuff like birthdays. You know, it's a really great feeling when you're falling for someone, but it's the parts that come after which normally suck (at least for FA's). It's part of being alone for so long that any interest shown in me I stupidly overhype but I can't help it. I conjure up these silly fantasies about travelling to her country and properly falling in love, raising a family... I really wish I wouldn't do this to myself but I've always been a hopeless romantic at heart. Emphasis on the hopeless. I want to share a picture of myself to her but I'm worried about the reaction. I've been waking up every day thinking of her and I don't even have much interest in playing the PC game I used to be pretty much addicted to, I'd rather just chat to her in Discord when she comes online and ask how her day has been, make her laugh and all that. Of course I've told her a lie or two, like how I've been in a short relationship before in high school (just to make me seem like less of a complete loser). I'm in my late twenties and she's a few years younger.

I'd also say that there are average and even above average men here or who are FA but don't visit this platform who would have been completely capable of having at least some success in dating.

The sad thing is that factors completely out of their control have stopped their development which now puts them in a massive disadvantage. Their parents could have made the wrong moves during the formative years, they might have been bullied, they might have been rejected several times in a row. All of these things could have made them have low self-esteem, led them to being the socially ostracized, quiet introverted guys. Due to how current dating culture works, these are all a death sentence that will crush any desire for one of the most basic things in human life. These guys will probably stay alone.

And the worst thing is that no matter if things change for the better, these men will be forever lost as their youth will have disappeared and the damage will have been done.

ForeverAlone,"Note: This is not a rant directed towards relationships(I didn't have any, and don't expect to), but dissatisfaction with life.

The amount of effort I have to put in to become 'happy', to me, just feels too much. For starters, I was bullied, and emotionally abused at home, so I'm a little stunted emotionally. I can't handle the slightest of criticism well, and I immediately feel very sad and cry a little bit after. Also, I am not a fully functioning adult, in the sense that I am not street smart and lazy about my personal health. I am 'whiny', because I often look back at my childhood and blame that for my problems, which I am supposed to change by taking 'personal responsibility.' As true as it is, it makes me very angry and frustrated. You could call me bitter.

There's nothing in life that makes me happy. I thought videogames would make me happy, so I bought GTA 4 on Steam. But then feelings of guilt appeared, that I was wasting time which I could have instead spent on 'improving' myself. So after resuming from a save game that I had kept from years ago, I uninstalled it.

But the thing is that 'improvement' takes effort. A lot of it. I don't know of any other way to put it, but it's HARD! And I guess it is so for the people here. How do you expect all people with actual mental trauma and unfavourable circumstances, that have actually negatively impacted them in their life, to change by doing something hard, that too with time and effort that take a good part of their life? You could say  ‚ÄòSweet are the uses of adversity‚Äô as Shakespeare did, which means that we should take bad events and circumstances in a positive way, as they BuIlD pErSeVaRaNcE and all that stuff, but I don't think majority of the people are mentally resilient for doing this.

So, what if I don't want to put that much effort? What if I just want to continue living like this, sad and unhappy, just because it's easy? It seems like that there is no dignity in accepting such a choice, and you are a 'loser', who 'blames his/her circumstances and others', and are told to 'stop whining'.

Outside of lunch hours the only non work-related subject is relationships. I don‚Äôt mind seeing couples on the street that much because I can tell myself it‚Äôs a fairytale.

ForeverAlone,"Over the years, iv'e been thinking that perhaps if I don't find a girlfriend in the United States, maybe I should look overseas and try and find a partner in a different country for a couple of different reasons.

Sometimes who you are as a person and what you offer in terms of qualities may not be seen as valuable in one location, but they're more valuable in a different location. For instance, if you're a gay artsy person and the town you live in is mostly country folk who are anti-LGBT, you'll likely have a hard time fitting in and finding someone to date. But if you move to San Francisco, you're more likely to be accepted and find someone who likes you. So perhaps one reason why some people wind up becoming alone for long periods of time is because they're simply living in the wrong location where their attributes aren't desirable or compatible with the majority of people. Perhaps trying to date in a different place or even in a different country might be a viable option to meet women if nothing else works.

Iv'e been thinking about going to Mexico, Thailand, The Philippines, or even another other Asian country where the women tend to be shorter and smaller compared to western women.  Currently I live in the United States and I feel like my 5 ft 3 height and light frame is a major disadvantage here in terms of dating. Women generally speaking don't want to date men shorter and smaller than they are and I believe this is a major reason why my dating life has so far been non-existent. But perhaps if I moved to a different country where the women tend to be short and small, then my height may be less of a disadvantage there.

ForeverAlone,"People who have been in relationships or who are in relationships love to put us down and insult our looks and intelligence. However, we are actually strong because while they‚Äôre waiting on their SOs to cook them dinner and buy them things, we are able to cook, go to work, and function on a daily basis.

People in relationships, from what I have seen, never break up unless they already have someone else lined up and would, by their own admission, kill themselves if they were single for more than a month.

On the other hand, we, although we dislike being alone, are mentally strong enough to go to our jobs and support ourselves and our family (parents and siblings) despite having no support whatsoever and nothing to ever look forward to the rest of our lives.

ForeverAlone,"Here's something a little more positive. What have you never done before that you would really want/try to do if you finally found someone? I imagine that a lot of us have had a lot of ideas build up in our heads over the years of how we would want to do things. On the other hand, maybe some of us have become so desperate or willing to take what they can get that they forgot to dream a little, or maybe feel to afraid to dare to dream. I know I've been there, but maybe this could help give positive motivation rather than *just* negative. 

I'll start with a few basic, perhaps corny, perhaps even childish things I would love to do when I finally find a long-term girlfriend:

\-Surprise her with breakfast in bed.   
\-Take her to something silly but alluring like a fair or carnival, from around dusk to night.   
\-Take her somewhere beautiful and peaceful, and surprise her with some kind of gift that would have personal sentimental value to her -- maybe something based on something she'd talked about before, or maybe some kind of creative thing I came up with myself.  
\-Spend time at night in one of our bedrooms where we hold and look at each other, maybe by a moonlit window, and have a deep talk.  
\-Experience that thing where one of us walks through the door and the other practically leaps on them and showers them in kisses.   
\-...Have sex, of course. I wouldn't want it to be the *basis* of the relationship, but I'm a virgin and it would really set me at ease to finally have a sex life. I'd hope to continuously get better at making

Come to think of it, one could feasibly coordinate to do all of those things in one weekend day.","If you make it out of this, what's are some relationship dreams you want to make real?",Key-Trade

ForeverAlone,"About 5 months ago, my ex decided to end our 5 year relationship because he couldn‚Äôt handle it anymore. We were in a long distance relationship, but he would visit 3-5 times throughout the year. We made it work. The distance was only supposed to be temporary as we had plans for him to move to my state once he got a few things in order. I gave him an entire year to prepare for this move, but he had made no progress on his own. The following year I started to push him to get things done (i.e. getting a passport, driver‚Äôs license, requesting to transfer work locations within the same company), but he began to see it as ‚Äúnagging‚Äù which then had only stressed him out. After 5 years, he decided to end our relationship stating that he ‚Äúneeded time to figure things out‚Äù. 

I had a gut feeling that there was someone else, but whenever I would ask him about it his immediate response would be ‚Äúno‚Äù. After a few days, I was finally able to get him to confess that there was indeed another girl whom he knew from work yet he claims that this had nothing to do with his decision to end our relationship. Not even a week after he broke it off with me, he had moved out of his parents‚Äô house and into a duplex where this girl also moves in with him. Needless to say, I was devastated and fell into a deep depression. 

I couldn‚Äôt sleep at nights so I started to take sleeping pills and at times I had considered overdosing on them, but had my family and friends to think about. I had completely lost my appetite which resulted in losing a lot of weight. It was difficult for me to wake up every morning and find the motivation to even get out of bed. Every time I would contact my ex in desperate need for some kind of comfort in all of this darkness, he would treat me like I was a burden.

Regardless of how bad it seems and feels during the moment, it is true when they say that ‚Äútime heals‚Äù because eventually I started to feel a sense of normalcy again. I had to find myself again and re-learn how to be happy and content on my own again. After a few weeks of no contact and feeling more and more like myself again, my ex started to reach out and tell me that he still ‚Äúloves and cares‚Äù about me, saying that he can‚Äôt stop thinking about me or seem to get over me despite how much he‚Äôs tried, asking if I would ever take him back if he wanted to come back in 6 months or a year, asking if I‚Äôd take him back in August once his lease is up, etc. Every chance that I‚Äôve given him to earn his way back, he could never put any of those words into actions. Instead he finds excuses not to end his relationship with this girl and asks if I would help pay for his bills if he leaves her to be with me again. Even while he and the break up had damaged my self-esteem, I know better than to let him or anyone take advantage of me.

Fast forward to now, although I am much better than where I was post-breakup 5 months ago, I am still not 100% over it. I have let my ex come in and out of my life, feeding me lies and false hopes, making me feel like I‚Äôve done wrong for only just talking to a few guys since the break up, and threatening to never speak to me if I ever block him again. Recently, he again insinuated that he wanted to be with me ‚Äúso badly‚Äù but wanted me to work on changing myself for him before he chooses to end his relationship with this girl. All that I could think about is: How absurd is it that he expects me to win him back after everything that he‚Äôs done to me while he is still in a relationship? I told him that I was finally done with the back and forth, the lies and misleadings, and blocked him.

I spent 5 years with this guy. He became my best friend, my world, and I thought he was the one person who I was going to spend the rest of my life with. I thought that I had finally found someone who understood me, accepted me, loved me unconditionally and who I could completely be myself with. But I don‚Äôt know him anymore. This selfish, manipulative, narcissistic, immature guy isn‚Äôt the same guy that I fell in love with. Or is this who he truly was the entire time? Had I been so blind for all of those years? I‚Äôve come to realize that you can never completely know someone regardless of time and that can be very scary. We, as humans, are always changing, evolving. So, how do you even trust another person with your heart or your life? Nowadays, guys only seem to be interested in hooking up and nothing more. I‚Äôm sure that I‚Äôm just bitter and jaded, but I‚Äôm beginning to feel like real, genuine love does not exist. At least not for me.",LOVE IS DEAD OR DID IT NEVER EXIST?,SASHINAT0R
ForeverAlone,"I was in another thread that basically said it‚Äôs ‚Äúgame over‚Äù once you‚Äôre 25 without prior experience, and I mentioned that I got my first adult relationship (not counting my early youth experience up until age 9, which I‚Äôm not sure counts) at age 26 in October 2018. Another user replied to me asking how that happened and if I had any advice; and as I wrote my reply, it stretched out long enough to justify its own thread, which I had been thinking of making anyway. I don‚Äôt want to make anyone feel worse with it, least of all those older and/or technically less experienced ‚Äî I just want to get the whole thing off of my chest and hopefully provide some kind of insight or inspiration to someone. So here‚Äôs the reply to that user:

The relationship only lasted a few weeks, but it was a good one. How it started is that a friend invited me and another friend to go with him to an odd singles event that he was a bit intimidated to go to by himself. Interestingly enough, he‚Äôs in his early 30‚Äôs and only had one relationship years ago, and might be a virgin too. The other friend was also a virgin with very little experience at 22. Funny how we managed to find each other without knowing that at first.

Anyway, I found out after the event that I and a cute woman I liked had picked each other, I called her and invited her on a date, and it went from there. I liked her character easily ‚Äî she was a substitute elementary teacher who also worked at a call center for some education-related thing, and she was very good with kids, elderly folk, and animals. She loved otters for some reason. She was also from the south (we both live in the US) and though she didn‚Äôt generally have an accent, it would start to come out when she‚Äôd tell different little stories about her time there. Also, many times when she didn‚Äôt make out something I just said, she would lightly cock her head and go ‚Äúhm?‚Äù in a light, soft voice. Just an all-around cute and likable person. I was pretty stoked when she liked me back and said, ‚ÄúCall me, ok?‚Äù after the end of the first date when I dropped her off at her place and kissed her.

It was a nice and sweet few weeks in which we held hands, went to different places around town together, and kissed a handful of times. Perhaps the crowning moment was when we had a stay-in movie date at her house and I made her happy with a documentary about otters. We cuddled, talked a lot, and had a long and passionate makeout session with tongue action that I will never forget as long as I live. I still kind of shiver when I recall the sensations or even the sounds or the way she looked with her eyes closed. Dreamy.

Sadly, she broke up with me not long after that date. She told me she was sorry and that I was a great guy who treated her sweetly, but she had decided to be ""more exclusive"" with someone she had been seeing ""on and off"". I actually wasn't too bothered at the time, mainly happy because I actually got relationship experience for once (at least since my early youth) and it was perfectly nice and healthy. However, I've tried and tried and haven't found anyone since, and I feel pained by the idea that A) I probably wasn't good enough to keep, B) she might not have even thought of me as her boyfriend so much as just one of at least two candidates she had been testing (maybe even at the same time), C) my inexperience might have shone through at points (though I never told her about it) in my slight awkwardness and the fact that I hadn‚Äôt kissed in about 18 years, and D) I‚Äôm still a virgin. Now I'm getting close to age 28 with fewer options than ever before due to lockdown, and I'm a self-loathing suicidal mess.

So I don't really have any advice other than to have multiple different leads constantly going at once, which maybe you're already doing. That's the only way I've ever gotten even a sliver of success: I'd meet people through friends or social gatherings (even if I‚Äôd just make friends at first), have online dating accounts, go downtown and try to talk to people (I did manage to get a few numbers this way, though none called back), do volunteer work, and even practice manifestation/visualization techniques on my own. Sometimes I‚Äôve even dropped almost every other hobby/pursuit I had and found different ways to spend as much of my spare time trying to find a relationship as possible. I feel embarrassed and inferior that I even have to go that far, that I have to constantly scratch and bite every day to get even a fraction of what for many seems to come so smoothly, but at least in the moment I can kind of feel like I‚Äôm doing something and moving forward.

So, not that I‚Äôm qualified‚Ä¶the best advice I could give for when you do get a date and want to win that person over as a significant other is probably dead obvious, but it bears repeating anyway: Make sure that you and your car are clean, nice, and fragrant, even if it means planning the date out just enough in advance that you can set aside time to clean the car and take it to the wash. Plan out the date in advance from routes to conversation topics (preferably with some creative/unique ideas beyond the usual dinner/movie and ‚Äúwhat do you do for a living?‚Äù or whatever), make sure you have the logistics figured out, and make sure you have alternate plans on hand in case one falls through (like if your date doesn't feel like going to a certain place or it's closed). Make note of and memorize the different things you‚Äôve learned about them or that you know they like or care about so that you can weave those things into conversation/action and thereby prove that you‚Äôre interested and think about them. Have a pack of gum ready not only to mint your breath up, but also to chew at one point when you‚Äôre out walking and to offer a piece to your date ‚Äî that‚Äôs a nice way to hint to them that you‚Äôre thinking about kissing them later. Keep a positive and upbeat vibe too. I definitely understand feeling depressed, but I can also definitely put on the right mood when on a date and even start getting up to it because it feels good to get to have that experience with someone.

All that might come off as a lot, but it's actually not that crazy. If you have those things down pat, you can make them seem and feel pretty natural when you actually get to doing them, rather than a scripted thing. For each of my dates I remember feeling nervous and kind of scrambling to finalize all my preparations in the fairly narrow time between when I got off of work and whatever time I had gotten her to agree on for when I could come pick her up from her place. But getting all of that shit out of the way and getting to the part where I got to make her feel happy and then finally kiss her on the lips, knowing that I really applied myself and hit one out of the park for her that night, is one of the best feelings I‚Äôve ever had. It is so worth it. If I ever wind up succumbing to self-destruction, I‚Äôll still think, ‚ÄúAt least I managed \*that\*.‚Äù

On one hand I feel pathetic saying all this, as though I‚Äôm proud and elated at finally learning just to crawl while seemingly the whole world runs much earlier. But I also like to think I‚Äôm just being grateful. I like to think that a lot of us who feel the intense shame and isolation of being romantically inexperienced and so far behind most of our peers will not take our actual experiences for granted if and when we get them. We know what it is to be really deliberate and conscious about love in order to find and keep it, and we want to make sure that whoever we‚Äôre with feels wanted, belonging, and successful because we know how important it is and how the opposite feels. We notice when we have a chance and we make sure to not blow it or at least to appreciate it, even if it‚Äôs just for a short time.

ForeverAlone,"Today I went to check my Yahoo email when I saw the link to the horoscope. Normally horoscopes only say things vaguely related to my life (even by horoscope standards), but something I saw today made me shiver with hope. Not only was the general horoscope so errily in sync with my life, it contained a specific detail that seemed almost omen-like to me.

I'm Gemini, and my weekly horoscope said with my emphasis added, 
""Oh...Gemini, expect a monumental week of developments in your love life story! Venus is still retrograde in your sign, but on Wednesday, makes a conjunction to the Sun. This will essentially light up your ability to call yourself out on whatever relationship issues you've been trying to hide from.&lt;b&gt;A Lunar Eclipse on Friday in your partnership sector will certainly signal a peak. You can eother expect an ending to occur or a deepening of your bond with someone&lt;/b&gt;. Much, of course, depends on where things have been going. If you're completely single, you are more emotionally open than ever to a connection! A karmic one may come into your life.""

Do you know what happens on Friday? I'll meet my future graduate school classmates (women included) in a Zoom webinar orientation. 

Like I said, I don't believe horoscopes, and there was always a good 1/7 chance of them saying something momentous would happen on the day it does (i.e. if I randomly prophesized I'd get a girlfriend on X day of the week, I'd have a 1/7 chance of being right no matter how many weeks it takes).

ForeverAlone,"Heya.

Being forever alone and in my 30‚Äôs, I got pretty excited when I began chatting with a guy off a dating app a month ago and he almost immediately said he wanted to be my boyfriend.

Long story short, he asked me to move to his city so we could be together.

A week before the move, I mentioned that I‚Äôd like to initially meet in a public place. He freaked out. He said stuff like ‚Äúyou‚Äôll never have a family, it‚Äôs all your fault, you wasted your time, if you aren‚Äôt ready for sex you‚Äôre not mature enough for a relationship, you‚Äôre acting childish, I‚Äôm never going to talk to you again.‚Äù

I figured that was that.

A few days later, he contacts me saying he will give me one last chance. This made me nervous because it sounded like if I stepped one toe out of line, he‚Äôd stop talking to me. By the way, he also immediately asked for nudes when we started talking. I felt like he wasn‚Äôt looking for a relationship and wanted to stop talking, but he said I must trust him because he went to seminary school for three years and almost became a priest but then got into a car accident.

Anyway I asked if he was sure he still wanted me to move there. He assured me everything was fine and he loves me. Long story short, I‚Äôve given up my job and have moved quite far, and he has no intention of meeting up with me and has barely talked to me since my arrival.

I am just sitting here trying to find a reason. A reason why I‚Äôm in a city I knew nothing about, alone. Why he asked me to come.

If it turns out I‚Äôm a bad person, I will be much more at peace with what happened, because I will know I deserve this.

When I was 15, it was a couple weeks before Valentine‚Äôs Day. I was in the shower, and even though I‚Äôm not religious, I prayed to find a girlfriend. I said please god, let me get a girlfriend this year. It was just me being a desperate 15 year old kid. 

Only a couple weeks later, a girl entered my life and she could‚Äôve been my girlfriend if I played my cards right. Crazy to think the universe listened to my prayer. She started talking to me, it was like you see in the movies. However, due to me being an anxious wreck and me simping over her, I got nowhere. I was so close, if I just took the risk I wouldn‚Äôt be here today writing this. She obviously liked me, I was just too nervous and granted I had strict parents that gave me no freedom, so I had no idea how I‚Äôd even get to a date. The universe led me to the water, but I couldn‚Äôt swim. Now I pay the price. 

I liked her for about a year and after that, I didn‚Äôt even try with girls in high school. I was a sad soul after that, I regretted my failure. After high school I went to community college, and I had no chances there to find anyone. I recently graduated so I will be moving on to go away to college in the fall, but even that may get taken from me due to COVID.

**The rundown:** I found an interest in dating last year just past my 25th birthday. I‚Äôve never been in a relationship or even on a date. I‚Äôm now 26, feeling like time is flying by! Spent most of the past year try to learn and improve myself. I quit porn (almost a year clean), toke up dance for fitness, upgraded my fashion, read a few books on dating, got myself out-there at parties and cold approaches.

Yet with all the changes I went through, I don't feel anymore confident than I was a year ago. I still feel like a shy 16-year-old boy! The point that really hit me hard was over Christmas when I asked out 3 different girls (that seemed kinda interested) I knew through college.

I know T injections shut down endogenous T production and you may have to take them life long.

 For those outside of the US- our colleges are very passionate about American football. Alumni love to go back to visit, tailgate and have fun all day before and after the game starts. It makes the campus and small town feel like thousands of tourists visited for a day. 
It was a beautiful September day in the Fall if 2019. I was excited to visit the school I just graduated 2 years prior to attend a football game and to see a couple friends I haven't seen in a while. I've been to many games before but this day hit me especially hard and made me feel so...empty.

I should be happy, excited, and in a positive mood. As I strolled through the crowds I couldn't help see things that I may never have in my life. Some things that I will never have the opportunity to have since I can't go back in time:

I saw many young couples who probably just met when they first started school, holding hands, laughing and smiling. They all seemed on cloud nine and they have their whole life ahead of them.

 I saw grandparents with their children and grandchildren rememebering old times and telling stories about how they met at the school.

I saw parents that were so excited to meet their son's/daughter's new bf/gf.

 I saw large friend groups with guys and girls together having fun and living life in the moment. (I never had girls in my friend group)

And the final dagger- a buddy of mine met a girl that day and now they have been dating since then. I'm happy for them and think they make a great couple. It's just so simple for some people.

 In the years prior to this, I did everything in my power to meet new people and to hopefully date someone. I joined clubs, lived with people who I didnt know previously, and made a pact to myself that if I liked a girl I had to ask her out. I wanted to experience the same things in my life that I saw so many other people have. Something I can look back on and share with family and friends one day. In the end, it never worked out for me and I feel cursed. I'm not an ugly person or anti-social but most girls I liked at school had a bf and most of them are still dating to this day I think. I kissed girls a few times but it was mostly when we were both drunk and in the end that didn't really matter to me. I wanted something real. Like many of you on here, it hurts to see others who get things so easy and we are struggling just for a piece of it.

I of course wanted more but it was never meant to be. Telling her that I love her was more of a formality because I knew it wouldn't happen, I saw how she was treating me.

ForeverAlone,"Wanted to clarify this topic just in case anyone is confused. When many girls talk, they may say one thing, but act another way. Just look at their actions as their true intentions, ignore their words. Most of the language they say is just due to social etiquette and structure. As cliche as it is, actions speak louder than words. A few situations below which I think are pretty straight forward, however there has been some confusion from some people I have see posted on this sub as well as people I have met in real life. These don't only apply to girls, but people you interact with as well.

A guy a my work was telling me that girls always tell him he is such a great guy, but they never want to go on a date with him. So I explained to him:

**Situation:** You ask a single girl you know  on a date. She says to you ""Sorry I am not ready for a relationship right now. But you're such a great catch. Any girl would be lucky to have you!"". Then a few weeks later you see her dating some other guy.

**Translation:** what she meant to say ""I'm not attracted to you and can't see you as my SO."" However, she may believe you are a 'great' person, she is just not sexually attracted to you. Also she may not want to say her real thoughts to you - girls need to be careful on what they say as guys can become aggressive in some situations. Also, saying the what she really thinks could be considered rude as well and against 'common social manners.'

&amp;#x200B;

People never want to meet:

**Situation:** You been talking to a girl you met online via text and even phone call. You want to meet, but every time you schedule a date, she flakes or says something came up. Or she says she is really busy and it is hard to meet with so many commitments.

**Translation:** She doesn't care enough to want to meet you. If a girl really likes you, she will find time to meet you.

This situation can also be modified to a someone you consider a friend to hang out with. Sure people have busy lives, but if they constantly keep saying they are too busy after multiple attempts to meet them and they don't bother to reschedule, they don't want meet you.

&amp;#x200B;

Ghosting/left on read/no reply to messages:

**Situation:** At work you email someone  regarding a few items you need their input on for a project. You give them a deadline by the end of the month. They tell you ""My work is pretty packed, but I will try to get to it."" Throughout the month you send email reminders, and they either respond they are busy or just ignore your emails. Then on your last reminder, you put a pretty aggressive reminder statement, and CC the CFO. And lo and behold, they provide the items you needed within a day!

**Translation:** The person didn't give a shit/respect you since they didn't provide what you needed until you included the CFO on the email.

Other situations can include normal text chats where you message people but they ghost/leave you on read/don't reply. If a person really wants to talk you, they will reply. Sure they may get busy and forget if they have lots of messages or get distracted, but if it constantly happens to you, they don't care about you. You think a boy friend will forget to respond to a text from his girfriend, or a manager will forget to respond to an email from the CEO? Cmon man...

ForeverAlone,"I've got to be the biggest dating failure I've ever known. I don't blame women for this either, I don't blame anyone else. I know it's all my fault and the result of my own shortcomings. I just wish I understood what it is I have to do though, and what success and not feeling chronically embarrassed even feels like, because the most I've managed is being able to be with someone (who I did like a lot!) for a few weeks before she (kindly) left me for someone else. I've tried cold approaches, I've tried going to multiple dating/speed dating events, I've tried going out by myself or with what few friends I've been able to get, I've tried getting numbers and calling them, I work out, I shower, I dress nice when I go out, I use cologne and gum, I try to put forth a cheery and optimistic demeanor, I do music and have my own projects, I have a career, I plan out dates with interesting things based on what they like, I've even (especially in recent lockdown times) tried online dating with professional photos and high-effort profiles and kind, detailed messages based on what's actually on their profiles and what reputable dating guides say I should do when messaging...but I just end up being ignored or ghosted or passed over or not called/messaged back, over and over and over and over again. I'm 27 and I've read lots of guides and I keep trying and failing and I just want to fucking die. I hate myself for not knowing how to just...Be human and properly socialize and connect with people, and the dating failures are the pinnacle of this. I've been having recurring vivid dreams lately of being with someone and having a special moment only to wake up, and today I got ghosted by someone right after she texted me basically saying she wanted me to come over. As years pass I feel more like I'll be a loveless, sexless loser with no lasting deep friendship forever.

Of course, now with quarantine I have even less avenues, but it hurts me still to be hitting it off with matches on Tinder and sometimes even get asked my number so they can text me, only for them to suddenly go silent when things seem to be going somewhere, even after I accepted an offer that sometimes *they* gave *me* to meet up. This has happened several times now, and I hate how weirdly addicted I am to the thought of, ""Maybe this time it's for real!"" only to be let down once more (and keep in mind I'm ok looking and in decent shape).

And please, I know it takes multiple tries to get this stuff. I don't expect to just win right out of the gate. But the problem is that I don't succeed at all, even after various serious efforts. It's not just multiple tries with me, it's countless times over several years with such tiny and fleeting (if any) progress. Real, functional human beings don't take over a quarter century to figure out this stuff. My life is passing me by and at times I'll be out and see people as young as teenagers walking around holding hands, or I'll hear about people signing up on Tinder and getting dates or even just casual encounters left and right, and I'm glad for them but it's just jsust;kasjd;falksdjhl bajsdohlgksaf;dhjbaoihulsdfhcjoklwds WHY AM I SO PATHETIC! I feel strongly like I would be able and willing to put in a lot of effort, care, and patience into a relationship because it'd be very important to me, but that doesn't really matter when I can almost never get started, let alone make it beyond the early dating stages.

I feel like I'm in a Catch-22 because the whole ""being yourself"" thing hasn't worked out for me (probably because I'm weird and apparently not socially calibrated), but trying to uphold an acceptable persona doesn't work either because it's unnatural and probably transparent, and I think I just come off as being boring and unexciting that way anyway. I don't know how much having Asperger's may have to do with this problem, but it seems I have no way of truly understanding what right things to say or do to land all the right steps in the process of getting somebody. I sure feel like an undesirable wretch when I'm not able to succeed as me \*or\* as someone else. And what makes it worse is the fact that people always say you can't find love if you don't love yourself, or that you'll be less attractive if you're down about failure in dating because people will be able to somehow smell the desperation or unhappiness on you and thus feel repelled by, but how am I supposed to stop feeling bad when I just keep failing over and over and over for years on end? I used to be happy and love myself, but that was before this kept happening and I started to realize what a failure I am. So now it's like I'm in a vicious cycle I can't break of feeling bad because I can't be with someone because I feel bad because I can't be with someone. It's like that thing of not being able to get a job because you don't have experience, only worse; and I feel this constant sense of panic and pressure like my time is running out and I really need to get this fixed but don't know what to do.

Maybe it's pointless to write all this, because I don't particularly expect anyone can help me, and maybe it doesn't make that much difference whether someone else here has similar problems -- in a way, I *don't* want other people to feel like this. Maybe I just wanted to vent, because I almost never talk to anyone about this, and certainly not to the extent I have here -- I'm *embarrassed* about it. Believe it or not, I actually posted my Tinder profile to feedback threads on the Tinder Reddit page for weeks every time such a thread showed up to see how people thought I could improve it, but even *those* posts just got ignored. Between the above and my ongoing general failures in finding and sustaining general friendship, I just feel like I may never get to know real mutual connection or understanding with anybody, and it makes me feel like a bad person and non-functioning, constantly behind human who should just be put down like a sick animal.

ForeverAlone,"So it all started in April 2018. I've met a girl, we've really had a great connection and everything, she was beautiful, hot body, attractive face with a femme fatale look. We talked and went out several times then I've decided to confess my love to her and I was successful and the universe felt aligned for me and I was so euphoric. But it all crumbled when I knew she had a 3 months hot boyfriend, 6'2"" with good facial structure etc... She then told me that she made a mistake and that she wouldn't ever pick me over him because he's hotter than me even if she admitted to feel more spiritually connected to me. This hurt a lot i had to enter a depressive cycle and do drugs but then i healed after a year. I met another girl, same cycle (good night talks, great connection some hanging out) but when i dared to confess she rejected me by saying that I'm not good looking enough to be her boyfriend and that she'd be too embarrassed to be called my girlfriend even if she had never trusted anyone like me and that she doesn't want to lose her ""bestfriend in the world"". It was fine for me this time i accepted it wnd moved on. I recently tried again with another girl. Same cycle again. She even told all her friends about me and my friends too that I'm her favorite person. This gave me so much hope to shoot my shot but again, she was repulsed by my looks and then she entered a relationship with a muscular hunk who's a clear sexist and an abuser. I get that women aren't owing me anything. I get that women are free to do whatever they want. But this is seriously fucked up. They always say that looks don't matter but that's bullshit.

its really just a double-edged sword now, i can be all by myself alone, which i most of the time really love, im rarely stressed and have it really quiet and cozy here, but i also know that willingly isolating myself will mess with my already bruised mental health even more, i already start to feel the long-term effects on it, like i have more and more difficulty talking about several topics or contributing to anything someone says (also here on reddit) bc as ive said before i only do things to literally survive right now. i also feel slower, both mentally and physically, i have a REALLY difficult time concentrating on something sometimes. my attention span has also become SUPER low, like i skip so many times when watching youtube videos or reading stuff.

i feel like ive just given up and letting myself go, which is kind of sad, but given the amount of stuff ive done to even keep up with all the other ones, who didnt have to go through MASSIVE amounts of ""self-improvement""  to barely keep up, it really starts to get tiring after a while, esp if your outcome always ends up the same. like fam there is just nothing for me to gain anymore, its just not doing any favour for me in order to keep bothering with all that shit on how to improve, improve and yet again improve. its just all so draining like honestly, i personally think that at some point, you just have to give up and accept that youre fucked up. like at some point you just have to throw in the towel and say to yourself that the train has departed and that there is no way back anymore. im also well aware that this ruins any chance for me to ever meet someone, bc of all the rotting at home, but i just dont know, how i am supposed to continue this ""existence"".

ForeverAlone,"I've got to be the biggest dating failure I've ever known. I don't blame women for this either, I don't blame anyone else. I know it's all my fault and the result of my own shortcomings. I just wish I understood what it is I have to do though, and what success and not feeling chronically embarrassed even feels like, because the most I've managed is being able to be with someone (who I did like a lot!) for a few weeks before she (kindly) left me for someone else. I've tried cold approaches, I've tried going to multiple dating/speed dating events, I've tried going out by myself or with what few friends I've been able to get, I've tried getting numbers and calling them, I work out, I shower, I dress nice when I go out, I use cologne and gum, I try to put forth a cheery and optimistic demeanor, I do music and have my own projects, I have a career, I plan out dates with interesting things based on what they like, I've even (especially in recent lockdown times) tried online dating with professional photos and high-effort profiles and kind, detailed messages based on what's actually on their profiles and what reputable dating guides say I should do when messaging...but I just end up being ignored or ghosted or passed over or not called/messaged back, over and over and over and over again. I'm 27 and I've read lots of guides and I keep trying and failing and I just want to fucking die. I hate myself for not knowing how to just...Be human and properly socialize and connect with people, and the dating failures are the pinnacle of this. I've been having recurring vivid dreams lately of being with someone and having a special moment only to wake up, and today I got ghosted by someone right after she texted me basically saying she wanted me to come over. As years pass I feel more like I'll be a loveless, sexless loser with no lasting deep friendship forever.

Of course, now with quarantine I have even less avenues, but it hurts me still to be hitting it off with matches on Tinder and sometimes even get asked my number so they can text me, only for them to suddenly go silent when things seem to be going somewhere, even after I accepted an offer that sometimes *they* gave *me* to meet up. This has happened several times now, and I hate how weirdly addicted I am to the thought of, ""Maybe this time it's for real!"" only to be let down once more (and keep in mind I'm ok looking and in decent shape).

And please, I know it takes multiple tries to get this stuff. I don't expect to just win right out of the gate. But the problem is that I don't succeed at all, even after various serious efforts. It's not just multiple tries with me, it's countless times over several years with such tiny and fleeting (if any) progress. Real, functional human beings don't take over a quarter century to figure out this stuff. My life is passing me by and at times I'll be out and see people as young as teenagers walking around holding hands, or I'll hear about people signing up on Tinder and getting dates or even just casual encounters left and right, and I'm glad for them but it's just jsust;kasjd;falksdjhl bajsdohlgksaf;dhjbaoihulsdfhcjoklwds WHY AM I SO PATHETIC! I feel strongly like I would be able and willing to put in a lot of effort, care, and patience into a relationship because it'd be very important to me, but that doesn't really matter when I can almost never get started, let alone make it beyond the early dating stages.

I feel like I'm in a Catch-22 because the whole ""being yourself"" thing hasn't worked out for me (probably because I'm weird and apparently not socially calibrated), but trying to uphold an acceptable persona doesn't work either because it's unnatural and probably transparent, and I think I just come off as being boring and unexciting that way anyway. I don't know how much having Asperger's may have to do with this problem, but it seems I have no way of truly understanding what right things to say or do to land all the right steps in the process of getting somebody. I sure feel like an undesirable wretch when I'm not able to succeed as me \*or\* as someone else. And what makes it worse is the fact that people always say you can't find love if you don't love yourself, or that you'll be less attractive if you're down about failure in dating because people will be able to somehow smell the desperation or unhappiness on you and thus feel repelled by, but how am I supposed to stop feeling bad when I just keep failing over and over and over for years on end? I used to be happy and love myself, but that was before this kept happening and I started to realize what a failure I am. So now it's like I'm in a vicious cycle I can't break of feeling bad because I can't be with someone because I feel bad because I can't be with someone. It's like that thing of not being able to get a job because you don't have experience, only worse; and I feel this constant sense of panic and pressure like my time is running out and I really need to get this fixed but don't know what to do.

Maybe it's pointless to write all this, because I don't particularly expect anyone can help me, and maybe it doesn't make that much difference whether someone else here has similar problems -- in a way, I *don't* want other people to feel like this. Maybe I just wanted to vent, because I almost never talk to anyone about this, and certainly not to the extent I have here -- I'm *embarrassed* about it. Believe it or not, I actually posted my Tinder profile to feedback threads on the Tinder Reddit page for weeks every time such a thread showed up to see how people thought I could improve it, but even *those* posts just got ignored. Between the above and my ongoing general failures in finding and sustaining general friendship, I just feel like I may never get to know real mutual connection or understanding with anybody, and it makes me feel like a bad person and non-functioning, constantly behind human who should just be put down like a sick animal.

Anyway I suspected her for a while and turned out to be right, I wasn't surprised at all when she finally came out with it (I kept acting like I didn't see it). It occured to me that it might be interesting to see what it looks like when someone is ACTUALLY flirting with you. I've misread so many ""signs"" that I was only 75% sure, I had a doubt that I was just imagining it all to make myself feel important or something.

I'm NOT trying to be a pig but it's a plain fact that she's not very attractive and she's depressed and her ex emotionally abused her,, so a lot of women probably aren't going to be this aggressive but it's still interesting to see. I hope cropped texts are okay.

The context of these is mostly gossiping/talking about people at work, and talking about being bored/wanting to do stuff because of the quarantine.

I don't think I need to explain those. I was pretty sure what was up because women have never said that kind of shit before to me. Eventually she said something like ""I want to tell you something but I'm not sure how you'll react"" and then she told me about a dream she says she had and then it was out there.

The interesting part is what I **didn't** see that I expected I would have:

1. A single discernible hint of interest when I talked to her at work (before quarantine).
2. Any kind of flirting (except the kind of stuff in the texts) before she ultimately came out with it.
3. Any reactions to my Facebook posts. Including pictures of me, she never heart reacted them for example, privately or publicly, or said I looked cute or sexy (she said I'm silly for one pic I took but that's it).

And that's what's really fucking with me now. I really have no idea what to look for anymore.

I understand many of us here have zero dating experience at all, wondering what it's like to even go on a date, and I can empathize with them very much, but almost making it out FA is an incredibly soulcrushing experience as well.

ages 1-17: ????

ages 18-19: after spending my childhood friendless and loveless, I somehow got into a LTR for 1 year. with my limited social skills and life experience, I tried very hard to be a good partner. she was my first love, and I naively thought I'd marry her someday. I was finally happy! nah, I was just her rebound from her high school boyfriend. I also ""had a car"" (her biggest reason for dating me, she later told me).

ages 19.5-25: depressive heartbroken void, but I still tried. logging probably hundreds of hours on dating apps, ""putting myself out there"", I managed to go on a handful of first dates that went nowhere. 5 almost 6 long years watching my peers date, marry, gain, lose, partners, and knowing ""the best years of my life"" were slipping away: absolutely painful. I coped via prostitutes, music, and memes. deep down, I still hoped I'd make it someday.

the night before I turned 26, I went on a date with a girl I met on an app (okcupid specifically). it was amazing. the chemistry was great, and we were talking about our second date before the first was even over. that had never happened to me before. I (naively) remembered some acquaintence, who'd gotten married, telling me they ""knew from the moment we'd met"" she'd be his wife someday. I thought maybe I'd had that moment. it had to be the universe's birthday present to me, right?

the next 4 months were like...something out of a movie. we had so much fun; we had so much in common and lived such parallel lives. we even went to the same college at the same time, majoring in the same thing but had never crossed paths till then.

I had that a-hah! moment. this was it. I finally made it. I'm not religious, but I remember lying down one night and literally praying it'd last (forever. and ever. let's make this last forever--reminds me we attended a festival blink-182 headlined, so the lyrics to First Date should go here).

nope!

she got ""scared"" of her feelings for me, which pretty much just meant she wanted to stay single in case her ex of 6 years would come back. they'd been together through most of high school and college, and he (supposedly) dumped her because of ""all the time he wasted"" with her.

2 years later, she's still pining for him from what I can tell.

I just wanted to love, be loved, have two kids, and a small house. nothing too grand or crazy, but I've kinda just given up since then. 

fuck it.

ForeverAlone,"First post here and I am drunk so please be nice

I'm a 24 year old guy. For as long as I can remember, I have never had really anyone I can go to for any kind of emotional support. 

Ever since I started to try and date in high school, it became apparent just how alone I really was. I never realized it before but I never had anyone I could call a friend. I decided that I wanted to try and change that. I tried going out more, handing out with people, even dating. The entire time, whenever I got close to someone, they would always end up using me for something. 

This trend continued from high school into college. I figured, new school, I can start over. I could not have been more wrong. If anything, it was worse. I became the target for all forms of hazing and torture. People would come up to me for no other reason than to try and mock and humiliate me. By the time I had finally graduated, I had the reputation of ""Most likely to become a school shooter"". 

It was also during college that the worst happened to me. I managed to actually get a date. I did everything I could do to try and make it go well. It was my first one in years. When the time came, not just her, but her sister, and boyfriend showed up to mock me even more.  It was at this point that I broke. 

I was never one for drinking. I did occasionally when watching TV in my apartment. After this incident, I wound up, and still to this day, a high functioning alcoholic. There isn't a day that I can't go without a drink, even 3 years later.

Now, I am 24 years old. I hate my job. I'm slowly killing myself with alcohol. And I have never once had a meaningful relationship with another person. What finally drove me to post this, makes it all the worse:

I thought I found a friend online. Turns out, they had their own issues as well and came to me saying they were thinking of killing themselves. After all was said and done, I had finally found someone who I could open up to, and who I thought had opened up to me with their problems, they left me too. After I helped them realize that there were other options, they just left.

So once again, I am alone. With nobody who even cares about me. If this continues on, I don't know how much longer I can go before I take my leave. I'm scared of being alone, but now I'm even more scared of opening up again because all that people do is use it to hurt me.",Why can I not form any meaningful relationships,DellOsso

ForeverAlone,"This was originally going to be a reply to a post, but I figured it was a bit more than a reply, so here I am.

Social networking, is a form of networking (its in the name lol). When you are on Facebook, insta, twitter, Reddit, etc, there is connectivity between the users (acquaintances, friends, family, coworkers, and so on). Some are more transient and superficial (reddit comment threads) than others (family on FB).

When you imagine the connections you have with people online you can classify them according to your real-world relationship with them. Whether they be strangers (none), reddit commenters (none unless you know their handle from an IRL meetup), Facebook friends (good chance you've met them IRL) and family (I sure hope you've met them IRL)

As the previous paragraph may have hinted, when you are applying for a job, the strength of the connection will definitely be a factor in your success applying for jobs. If you are a total stranger applying from a public job board, there is a damn near certain chance that you will send in your resume, get the boilerplate ""we've received your application"" then never hear from them again. On the opposite end, if you are leveraging your family to get a job application, you have a much higher chance of getting hired as you have someone to vouch for you internally. The strength of your network is a massive benefit to getting that job, where your connection has given you a benefit that the 10 thousand other people applying as total strangers do not have.

Going into the dating narrative, the wording is still applicable where someone  sending the message via a dating website  probably won't get a reply versus the referral through a trusted intermediary (friend most likely) has much better chances of getting you a date (interview).

There is more to be said about the impact of having a negative outcome, in either scenario, will have on future prospects depending on the degree of negativity. If you burned the bridge completely, word will make it back to your connection and will impact their willingness to refer you in the future (and even proliferate in your network and cause others to withhold future opportunities and even cut ties) and vice versa.

Part of the meta theory of the application process is your work experience. A candidate with no work experience is seen as having no connections to other companies, a weak network (see the jokes about 3-5yr experience required for entry level jobs). Similarly for dating, a person with no social network is seen disfavourably, in both scenarios similar questions pop up: ""why has no one else hired this person?"" vs ""why does this person have no friends?"" 

How does this tie into FA? Well the way I see the FA crowd is those of us who have little to no connections for meeting new people, which is a first disadvantage. Then as the previous paragraph states, even if you attract someone's attention, the lack of work experience/friends is seen as a big red flag.

There are other things I can add such as the interconnectivity of others impeding your progress (rumours, blackballing) without you necessarily being aware, since that information doesnt bridge its way from those networks to you.

I gave up on love a while ago I'm 28 years old and I've just had unsuccessful relationships after unsuccessful relationships. I guess my flaw was I tried to see the good in people but it just went downhill, my last relationship had me at my lowest point. I found out the girl I was seeing was having an affair behind my back and when I confronted her about it she had lied to the police and said that I hit her and had me arrested, luckily for me the case was thrown out a year later due to lack of evidence but in that time frame I had lost my job due to the case and I fell into a deep depression that I thought alcohol could cure but it didn't.

Also, as clich√© as it sounds I just don't feel that anyone would understand.

I saw this post and thought maybe it might be therapeutic for me to share, because at least here I'm pretty much anonymous. Although in my case it's a complicated story that requires a lot of details to be established. To be honest I don't know why I'm writing this; I dread the stock comforting response of ""there's plenty more fish in the sea"", or ""you just have to let go"". A big part of me hopes no-one will even read this, but here goes...

From a young age I was always sucked into the whole ""Disney"" idea of love and relationships, I have always been a sensitive guy. Looking back I think this is because the relationship between my father and mother was filled with lies, deceit and abuse, so I sub-consciously vowed to be the perfect husband to someone one day.

Unfortunately this was not meant to be. Sometime in my mid-teens I began to develop mental health issues. It would be over 10 years before getting an accurate diagnosis: Borderline Personality Disorder, or BPD. Now, this is an important detail as a major symptom is how it distorts a person's perception of relationships, you could idolize someone one minute, and hate them the next. Also add in some impulsive behaviour, intense emotions; including loneliness, an irrational fear of abandonment and chronic depression for the shits and giggles. Not really a strong candidate for a husband, but after two years of soul searching and introspection I've come to terms with that now.

Just over two years ago I was in my final year of university. My gap year lasted a few extra years so I was in my late twenties. I got into the wrong crowd in my first year and became a heavy drug user. Was I an addict? Maybe, but it's been two years since I've taken anything. For me the drugs were a way to try and connect with people, (albeit on a false and superficial level) to combat the loneliness. Spoiler: drugs don't work. Having deep and meaningful conversations with people was so much easier for me on drugs, when I'm sober trying to connect feels strange and unnatural, I can't explain why. So I've always been a bit of a loner.

One night I was at the end of my rope, I was recovering from a failed suicide attempt but because of the intense loneliness I had the urge to try it again. Instead I decided to take some cocaine and visit a mental health support chat room. Then I ""met"" her, there was something about our conversation that just felt so right (of course it did I was off my tits on cocaine). We spoke about what we were going through, things we felt that no-one else understood, things we wished people could see through our eyes. It's at this point I should mention that she has BPD as well and from Serbia, whereas I'm from the UK.

So that was our first conversation, but from then on we carried on talking every day without fail. After a few chats we exchanged Skype details so we could see each other, it soon became clear to both of us that we were attracted to each other. We supported each other, shared coping mechanisms about our illness, spoke about our dreams, hopes, the future. She helped me get off the drugs (I've been clean ever since), I helped her stop drinking. We carried on speaking for about a year and our relationship grew into something more, we then started talking about meeting each other.

I had tickets to Serbia booked, it was all arranged, she would meet me at the airport, I would hire a car and stay at a hotel in her hometown. We joked that I would stay in the hotel giving her the option to escape to her home in case I was shorter than she expected.

I had never felt excitement like this before, I felt so lucky, had butterflies in my stomach, the world seemed brighter and more colourful. With her support I had finally gotten my life on track and for the first time I actually began to like who I was.

There was only 4 days to go until my flight, and then...

Nothing...

Silence...

I couldn't get hold of her. I tried calling and leaving messages. Nothing. I remember the day I was meant to fly out vividly. I went to the airport anyway, hoping that I would get a last minute call or message saying our plan was still going ahead in time for me to get on the flight.

Nothing.

I waited at the airport for a couple more hours event after the flight I was meant to be on had left. I remember sitting for hours just staring at my phone. I remember how I felt then.

I felt nothing.

The next couple of weeks were tough, I assumed she just got cold feet and decided meeting a guy who found her online wasn't such a good idea. Which I could understand and come to terms with somehow, even though it hurt. Unfortunately the truth was far worse than that.

A friend of hers got in touch and informed me that she was in hospital after an attempted suicide and wasn't in a good way. What made the situation worse is that the treatment of mental health patents in Serbia is awful, and there was nothing I could do to help her. Her friend told me she would speak to me as soon as she got out.

So I waited.

I had to hold on to hope that she was okay, and that she still cared for me, so I decided to throw everything I had into my degree and to stay sober. All the hard work paid off in my final project and I finished my degree as one of the top students in my class.

The day before my graduation ceremony, I got a message from her. She seemed... different, something had changed. She said that I need to let go of the idea of meeting her, to be honest, I didn't, not right away anyway. We carried on talking on and off for another year or so, checking in on each other, making sure we were okay. She found a boyfriend who she seemed happy with, I told her I was happy for her and I genuinely meant it, it was then I finally let go of the idea of meeting her.

It was her birthday a few weeks back. I opened Facebook to wish her Happy Birthday, but without any indication/explanation as to why she has now blocked me.

Perhaps it was doomed from the start with us being in different countries and both having the same mental illness. That's how I have processed it anyway. I still think about her every day, probably very unhealthy but I can't help it. I've let go of a lot of things after all of this, the whole dream of a ""fairy tale love story"" (you could say I've ""manned-up""). My desire to find someone and start a family has all but faded away, I'm 30 this year so I feel I'm at the point in my life when choosing to be alone is a conscious choice, rather than 16 year old me screaming ""I'LL NEVER LOVE AGAIN"" when ""Laura"" in high school got with my best friend (fucking bitch). I live alone now, I work from home and I have a dog who is all the company I need. I have friends that I see on a regular basis, but I try to keep a safe distance.

After everything, the question that still haunts me is: ""was it real?"" Was any of it real? As I mentioned at the beginning, BPD distorts perceptions of relationships, one minute you could idolize someone, the next you could hate them. It seems that this describes her point of view about me, but is the same thing happening to me and I just can't see it? Were we nothing more than just symptoms of each other?

I'll probably never know, to others I might just seem crazy, and it's okay to believe that.

I tried messaging her again around Thursday night but no response until Friday. I thought I had avoided getting ghosted at first but she was unresponsive after her initial Friday response. I tried sending one last message last night to see what the reaction would be and didn‚Äôt get a response until this morning. She said that she wasn‚Äôt sure that she wanted to keep talking with me since she wanted to use the quarantine to ‚Äúfocus on herself‚Äù. We had a small back and forth where she said that the pandemic makes it hard to communicate with someone and that now was a strange time to be talking to a match. I just said I understood her points and hoped we could begin talking again in the future. Now, here‚Äôs the caveat. When we began talking through text on Wednesday night, she revealed that she had recently got out of an emotionally abusive relationship a few months ago and how much it had affected her. Also, FWIW, she had ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt know‚Äù on her Basic info section for where you say what  you are ‚ÄúLooking for‚Äù e.g. Casual, Relationship, etc. Does anyone think that she may still be getting over this past breakup and felt awkward continuing with me or do you think I should believe her reason for not wanting to talk anymore? I still have her number and am still matched through the app. Does anyone think it‚Äôd be worth it to contact her once things with Covid calm down?",Did Covid-19 crush my hopes or did something else?,estev90
ForeverAlone," Growing up in a broken home kickstarted this cycle, School failure, unemployment, social failure. All because my moronic parents thought it was a good idea to have children in their dysfunctional relationship. My shrink doesn't know what to do with me because im pretty normal except for fatigue and a crushed self esteem. The last time someone showed affection to me, I actually got so motivated that I made my driver's license in my mid 20's because suddenly I felt like I have something worth living for. After contact was lost it was going back to being a depressed man again. ""Power of love"" isn't just Hollywood babble.

ForeverAlone,"Hey guys. One thing about me that stands out is how anxious I get. People think I am incompetent because I get anxious.

I havent had a girlfriend for 6 years of highschool, which is fine but it doesnt give me experience that I need in the future.

I know that everyone develops at their own pace but I cant help feeling behind...

Im always annoyed at people who's straight A, have a great friend group, have relationships because they dont know how we feel.

ForeverAlone,"Please bare with me. I have only really talked about this stuff to a couple of people, but my depression is getting to the point where I feel like I'm losing my mind.

My family was broken from the first memories I have. I lived with my dad at first, who was obsessed with finding women to love. He has been in 5 failed marriages, currently on his 6th. I go through a constant cycle with him. When he's single he acts like the world revolves around me and I'm his only reason to live, and as soon as he finds someone he stops checking in as much, and when I don't reach out to him he gets angry like I'm ignoring him, when the truth is I just hate that amount of pressure, followed by complete dismissal.

In his 3rd marriage I ended up with 2 step sisters and a step brother. He was 14. I shared a room with my step brother. From the age of 6ish-9 he sexually assaulted me regularly, he also physically assaulted me as a warning to keep quiet. I repressed those memories for quite a while, they didn't come back to me until I was 15. The only reason this stopped is because that marriage started to fail, and my dad took me and dumped me on my mother.

My mother, up until recently, was a workaholic for most of my life. She believed she was doing what was best for me and my half-sister(who lived with her her whole life). My sister is 6 years older than me. My sister and I got along when I was young and would only come for visits, but as soon as I was living there that all changed. She became explosive is the only word I can think to describe it. She would swing between emotions so often and violently it was hard to predict her. Sometimes we'd get along great, and the next thing I knew we were in a fight. She was not terribly big or strong so it wasn't like she was actually hurting me physically, but the emotional pain of having yet another family member treat me like I was garbage, or even worse, the enemy was staggering. She would abuse the desire I had to be close to her often, asking me to walk her to school even though she was older than me, which would then leave me ( a 10 year old) to walk another 2 miles alone to my school.

During most of this time my mother was too obsessed with working to notice all that was happening. My sister has some sort of psychiatric issue, I don't know what because she hasn't been diagnosed, but apparently my grandmother had it, though my mom hasn't mentioned what it is. Idk, maybe I have it too. Anyways, she ran away from home when she was 16, and got involved in drugs, and all sorts of other nonsense. She is 36 now and has had 4 kids with 4 different dads, is still a drug user and has lost custody of all those children (my mom and step-dad raise 2 of them). When she ran away my mother finally took notice. Of her. I know it was childish and silly of me at the time, but I felt so completely insignificant. I started acting out, ditching school often, only doing the bare minimum to make grades and what not. I don't mean to be overly cocky, but I am extremely intelligent. Not just by my own estimation, but it has been told to me many times. My IQ is very high, but because of all of this my EQ is so extraordinarily low that I am unable to deal with handling life. So I squandered whatever potential I had in order to get someone to notice me. It never worked really.

I did graduate high school, and took a few AP classes like physics and calculus. When I applied myself, I excelled, but unfortunately I often could not find the motivation to apply myself. I have had one serious girlfriend in my life. I got involved in church youth group, probably for the wrong reasons as well. Simply to feel involved in something. To get noticed. I dove all in. I didn't really evaluate too hard as to whether I really believed in God or not, my mom and step-dad had just always gone. I met someone who finally noticed me. A mentor, the youth pastor, Allen. He honestly is a good person.

I dove all in, I was the youth intern for quite a while, was constantly there trying my best to help and to do what I believed the Bible was telling people to: love others as yourself. Give everything to Jesus and others around you. I didn't worry about what my future would hold because I really believed I was doing good there. I was.... happy? for a time. I'm not entirely sure looking back on it. I decided I wanted to be a pastor. I was told I need a degree for that. I asked the church and the pastoral staff for help, because I was in no way going to get a scholarship. They told me if I can't do it on my own, I must not want it that badly (not in those exact words, but that was the essence of what I was told by the different people I spoke to.) I didn't resent that at first, I just continued to dive all in. I went and took loans and started to go to college. I worked two jobs as well. Half-way through my first semester I was in a car accident. My car was totalled and I couldn't afford another. My school was 30 minutes away by driving. So I once again asked for help, and was told there was none.

So I biked to college. Almost 3 hours every day, biking back and forth. It was during this time that I met my only girlfriend. I honestly don't know how I managed it. She was stunningly beautiful. We both attended that church. But we both had serious emotional issues that neither of us was truly prepared to deal with on our own, much less in a relationship. However, due to repeatedly being let down by church ""help"" I had started to grow bitter, and refused to go for counseling or help. This is when my past abuse began to rear its ugly head. I would often become convinced she was going to leave me, and would act out horribly. I never hit her, but I did grab her in anger a few times. I hate myself constantly for it. The worst was yet to come though.

We started having sex after about a year of dating, I dropped out of college, gave up on my dream, and mostly gave up on church. I believe that in the book of Acts the Bible is telling the church how they should live.  

**The Fellowship of Believers**  
*(*[*Acts 4:32-37*](https://biblehub.com/bsb/acts/4.htm#32)*)*

[**42**](https://biblehub.com/acts/2-42.htm)They devoted themselves to the apostles‚Äô teaching and to the fellowship, to the breaking of bread and to prayer. [**43**](https://biblehub.com/acts/2-43.htm)A sense of awe[*j*](https://biblehub.com/bsb/acts/2.htm#fn) came over everyone, and the apostles performed many wonders and signs. [**44**](https://biblehub.com/acts/2-44.htm)All the believers were together and had everything in common. [**45**](https://biblehub.com/acts/2-45.htm)Selling their possessions and goods, they shared with anyone who was in need. [**46**](https://biblehub.com/acts/2-46.htm)With one accord they continued to meet daily in the temple courts[*k*](https://biblehub.com/bsb/acts/2.htm#fn) and to break bread from house to house, sharing their meals with gladness and sincerity of heart, [**47**](https://biblehub.com/acts/2-47.htm)praising God and enjoying the favor of all the people. And the Lord added to their number daily those who were being saved.

I still have not seen a single American church who lives this way. If the people in charge of the church don't live this way, then honestly how real can it be? Idk about all that, but that was my ""reason"" for leaving the church. I'm still conflicted about all that but that is not the point of this post at any rate.

As our relationship grew more isolated from any friends we used to have, I became totally isolated. I only maintained 1 friendship outside of my girlfriend. I also met up with her best friend and boyfriend every once in a while, but as a whole I think my depression had finally won and I stopped trying. We had a consensual sexual relationship, but had both agreed to use protection. There were two times where I attempted to start without protection, and she would say no, but it took me a few seconds to come back to myself and realize what I was doing. I essentially raped her, she told me she felt as much. I did stop myself, and she (at the time) said she forgave me, but it still is not ok. I never really was as good to her as she deserved, but about 3 1/2 years into the relationship I stopped being horrible. (the first year was amazing, as is the usual with new relationships). I think as soon as sex became involved, due to my unresolved abuse, I fell apart. But somehow I managed to start treating her with respect. We were together for 5 years. At the end, she confessed to cheating on me. I was angry, but told her I understood why, and that I forgave her and if she wanted to keep working on us I was in. She said she wanted that. 3 days later she broke up with me. She is now married to the man she cheated on me with. We broke up about 2 1/2 years ago. I think I'm still in love with her, if my horribly twisted mind is capable of that, that is.

I just turned 30. I am basically incapable of having casual conversation with people because I often don't see the point in ""small talk."" I hate myself with every fiber of my being and genuinely feel I deserve this loneliness, because to be honest I am everything I hate. What kind of monster did I allow myself to become? The abused who became the abuser. Never thought it would happen to me. I know that I am not living up to even a fraction of the potential I could have had. I am a fucking delivery driver for Fed-Ex. I know I have the intelligence to be more, but I have a hard time finding the emotional drive to try. 

I have tried psychologists, and therapy but honestly I don't have the money anymore nor do I feel they help that much. When I go in knowing what my problems are, just not how to deal with them they seem taken aback. They always want to ""go back to the beginning"" and have me recite my whole life story in hour increments over the course of years. I'm not sure I have years. I think about suicide on a damn near hourly basis. I deserve it to be honest. I doubt I am ever going to find any sort of happiness in this life again, nor do I really deserve to. Essentially the only reason I haven't is because I don't want to put my parents through that. I have no friends, and rarely talk to my coworkers except about work. I want to find someone to share my life with, but I am also terrified of it. Of myself. And of other people honestly. I have been hurt, and have done the hurting, far too often. I can't continue to go through this cycle of pain just to find ""the right one."" If the next one isn't the right one I doubt I could handle it. I honestly probably should just accept being alone though, because people, no matter who they are, deserve someone much better than me.

I don't know why I made this post really, perhaps as a last ditch effort to see if anyone out there could honestly say to me ""you're not evil."" Even if they did, I don't know if I could believe them. Just needed to get it off my chest I suppose. If anyone made it to the end of this tirade, thanks for listening to my story.","This is long, but I have to vent somewhere",Mokhalar

ForeverAlone,"Hey guys, to be honnest I'm quite emotional as I'm writing so bare with me if I mess up the grammar.

Something happened today and it really triggered some nasty feelings in me. Feelings I would like to share...

Me (m26) and my friends group are discusing the importance of good looks in dating. How much personality and game really matters. To test this me and a friend which is more successful with the ladies swapped images on our dating profiles. This friend is a hardcore proponent of game and personality (I wonder why, lol). Any way, when I have his face on my profile I get so much more attention. Girls are now complimenting my taste in movies, my interest for things like history and philosophy, but they never did that when I used my own picture.

I know it's a bit commical, but this actually really hurt me. I already work out 5+ times a week and I'm on a whole food diet. The pictures we used are only of the face so clothes are irrelevant. 

Now that you have the background of my emotions, I can get to my question. So I moved to a big city when I was 23. I knew no one there and I had never been in a relationship. Some people suggested I try Tinder to get in touch with girls, I did and as you probably already guessed had very little success. This was a devastating discovery to me, I always thought I was a decent looking guy.

I tried some other dating services but had no luck there. I went to bars and clubs, I got friends and a bigger network. 3 years later still no luck. While all of this happened I struggeled with depression, anxiety and insomnia, it was hell. I tried talking to my family and explain the horrible dating market, after all society tells men to be open about their feeling. Long story short, they thought I exaggerated and didn't take me very seriously. This confession actually ruined my relationship with my sister. We used to love each other, but after finding out what a wierd loner I am, she does not talk to me anymore. This really hurt.

I've tried to communicate the dating issues to many different girls, friends of friends, collegues, etc. In general they seem either oblivious about it or in denial, so far I never met a girl who said ""sorry to hear that, your situation sucks"". Honestly this drives me up the wall. We constantly hear about caring about all sorts of minorities and women in pain. But when a man sais he is in pain no one gives a fuck (at least that's what it feels like, maybe I'm biased).

I even spoke to a female psychologist and she said I was deluded, that the dating market is fine. She also thought I had aspergers and got me tested, newsflash I don't have any disorder. This just added to my frustration.

Back to the dating experiment with my friend today. After the experiment I told a female friend how sad I was when discovering how much more attractive my friend are than me. She knows I've been depressed and suicidal in the past. What was her respose you wonder? She laughed. Yepp, that's right. My situation was amusing to her. Idk, maybe I'm overreakting. Maybe society really cares about dudes, but missed me. My intuition tells me otherwise. Any way reddit, what do you think?",Do women respect the suffering of men?,theTrollChurch
ForeverAlone,"So I matched with this girl on Tinder (really attractive) and after we matched, I went straight to add her Snapchat and we talked for a little more flirting and whatnot. Then she hinted at meeting up because she's been feeling ""lonely"" and I took the hint and teased her saying, ""you're gonna have to pay for these cuddles haha."" Basically, in short, she wanna chill and do the drill with me, just up to me to tell when I'm free. I'm not turning that down so I told her I will let her know.

If you don't already know, I'm a kissless virgin. I suggested to her during our texts that I only want oral sex but not why. I just don't think I'm ready for anything like that, even though if I wanted to, I could. Maybe I'm scared of how I would perform. You can consider this a blowjob hookup strictly but could I finally kiss a girl after 21 long years? Are there some things I should do to prepare or just relax and go with the flow?

There are a couple of things that I do want to before our meeting. Obviously, I can't get a haircut but I can groom and freshen up by shaving off my bummy sideburns. I won't tell you the other thing I will groom lmao. Anyways, I hit her back up asking her if we could take some pictures together and she said we could. That's cool of her because I know it's a cringy thing to ask (like she's a celebrity) but I just don't have any photos with girls on my phone as normies do. I want that too. I'm excited about this.

ForeverAlone,"I encountered this situation a lot, especially in college. Basically it was always the same process. I would work up the nerve to talk to a girl, then try to impress her, be funny, try my best to make myself appear attractive, but for the most part nothing ever worked.

The truth of the matter is, if someone finds you unattractive, you're facing a brick wall. You can try to get their attention, be kind to them, help them out in various ways, but nothing you ever do will make them like you. At most you will only ever be a friend to them, sometimes even an acquaintance. They will always keep their distance. This was particularly crushing for me because I grew up being fed the mostly false belief that if you try hard you will succeed, that hard work breeds success etc., but mostly it was one big lie. Some  girls will give unattractive guys a chance and vice versa, but most people have a certain minimum level of attractiveness below which they fundamentally exclude someone as a potential partner no matter how good their attributes, with the exception of some extreme situations (i.e. famous, very rich, etc.) You have no say whatsoever in their decision, which is virtually instantaneous (or taken within maybe 10 minutes of meeting you at most), and it is set in stone. Girl isn't attracted to you? Congratulations, you've officially been sorted into her unattractive bin, and nothing you ever do will help you get out. What's more, many attractive people actually pride themselves on callously casting unattractive people aside, seeing it as a testament to their own superiority and social power.

Every time I got rejected, I would try again, and the process just kept repeating itself. How many times in college I went through this process? 10? 20? I don't even know because I lost count. But at some point the realization hit me that this was largely outside my control. I liked these women unconditionally, and they didn't like me, or at least not as more than a friend, unconditionally, and the common denominator was generally looks. Sometimes entirely, sometimes the personalities didn't quite match up but looks always played a part, I'm quite sure of that. 

Now I'm 27, and I'm doing marginally better. Some close calls, but still a virgin and never had a real ""relationship"" that lasted more than about 2 months or so. I still don't consider myself good looking, but I'm probably good looking enough to attract some girls, except now I'm usually too shy to flirt because after so much rejection your self-confidence and your belief that it will lead to anything meaningful goes completely down the drain.",The worst part about being unattractive is knowing that there is nothing you can do to make someone like you,shydude92
ForeverAlone,"I honestly don't know if this is the place for this, but all the other relationship subs seem to revolve around pre existing relationships. 

The last 3 to 4 months have been getting progressively more and more painful for me. I have never been in a relationship before (not entirely for lack of trying) and its really starting to beat down on me.

I've passed the phase of wanting to be in a relationship for popularity and sex, which seems to be the bulk of highschool relationships, and find myself simply wanting a best friend. I know how terrible I feel all the time and those people in my life that help me day by day mean an unimaginable amount to me. If I can be that person to someone else, I would be thrilled. I want to be the person someone can trust with their life, I want to be there for them in every victory and failure. I want to be wanted and loved as much as I love them.

Problem is... the real only way to say it..... I hate myself. My therapist asked me if there is anything that I do enjoy about myself and I drew a very hard blank. The only thing I could come up with is that I am an extremely loyal friend (probably because I know if I am not a good friend I will lose the few I have). These thoughts and feels keep piling up more and more and everyday I feel like I am going to crack. Any goal I set of improving myself (ex. my weight, I'm 5'7 but weight 230.) seems like an impossibly long endeavor, when I feel that I need mental relief asap. On top of that, because of how much I disgust myself I feel extremely guilty for expecting a ""type"" of my own. Like I would like someone to not be as heavy as me, but I can't even follow my own wishes. Things like this create even more feelings of hatred and hopelessness. Quite frankly I am spiraling out of control and can't catch myself.

I am completely lost and haven't got the slightest idea of where to start.

ForeverAlone,"Let‚Äôs face it. I‚Äôm turning 25 this year and the fact that I‚Äôm still experiencing long-term dating problems and sexlessness is pretty indicative of my attractiveness to the opposite sex. Not trying to say I‚Äôm a hideous monster, but it‚Äôs just as good as. 

I probably don‚Äôt appeal to the average woman. My only hope of escaping this is finding someone who is a lot like me. They‚Äôre certainly a rare breed, lol. People always talk about having types and women going after different things (which I totally believe don‚Äôt get me wrong) but it‚Äôs hard to remain hopeful that anyone considers me to be their type. I guess that‚Äôs what being perpetually single does to you: you can‚Äôt really have faith in someone else finding you desirable. Plus I wonder if after all this time, finding someone will be worth it. Like I‚Äôd love to have experienced a normal love life throughout my teens and early 20s but it feels fucked up finally figuring it out in my mid 20s. 

If I finally end up dating someone, my partner will be the exception and not the rule. They‚Äôll have to be the type of person to like someone as weird as me. Hmm.",My only hope of finding someone is finding someone who is equally weird as I am.,Hellblade999

ForeverAlone,"I remember back in elementary school people actually thought I was cool. I was one of the early popular kids. I was actually really athletic at the time and excelled in our local youth football team.

The thing is I just kind of stopped growing and people just stopped hanging out with me.

Early on all of my friends were on the football team, after I quit in 8th grade because I was too small I couldnt really make any other friends.

Highschool came around and I was somewhat optimistic. Maybe I‚Äôd grow a bit. Entering freshman year of highschool I was standing at a mighty 4,11. I remember there was a girl in my American history class that would talk to me, I got her number and eventually she convinced me to send her intimate photos. To my surprise after this she just stopped talking to me. Turns out she showed the pictures to everyone who would look.

I earned the nickname ‚ÄúKeebler‚Äù because of how small I was and because of jokes about my photo. 

At home things are t much better. My step dad refers to me in feminine pronouns and degrade me, not to be mean, they are jokes but still.

My mom is the type of person to get all kinds of weird obsessions and she never really focused on me.

Today I‚Äôm 17, I want to gouge my eyes out so I don‚Äôt have to see the world anymore. All I want is for someone to hold me while I cry at night, but I‚Äôm too small for anyone to love me.

ForeverAlone,"I‚Äôm 20 years old and female. Although I‚Äôve had relationships in the past, they were never serious and I always seem to ruin things with my fear of intimacy and lack of any real social skills. 

For the past two years I‚Äôve used tinder on and off. It‚Äôs the only way to meet other girls here as the lgbt community isn‚Äôt huge near me. I never get anywhere; I either get ghosted altogether or things naturally just die out over time. Ive dated a couple of people but I feel that I scare them off before anything really develops. I really don‚Äôt know how to talk to other women at all. I‚Äôve convinced myself that I‚Äôm boring, weird, ugly and completely unloveable. 

I‚Äôve tried to work on myself a lot more - got a job, my own place, got back into therapy and found new hobbies, but no matter what, I can never overcome my social inadequacies.

ForeverAlone,"Not a native speaker but I'll try my best to explain it.

Basically what I mean is that other people have given me the idea that I'm actually not that terrible. For example my mom, telling me the girls must be lining up for me, how the gym has paid off etc. Or family asking if I got a girlfriend yet, when am I bringing a girl home. My dad gives compliments and recently said a girl was checking me out. I told my parents about a crush I had (just needed to vent) and they encouraged me to make a move, even when the girl in question has a boyfriend. This plants the idea in my mind, to the point where I actually start believing she likes me back. Right now I can't objectively look at the situation, because one part of me is saying she likes you, the other part says she's just being friendly. I told a friend about it too and he said it sounds like she likes me, but why would she stay with her boyfriend then? She's a very touchy feely and upbeat person, so that doesn't help me, it severely clouds my judgement.

What I'm saying is that I've been wrongfully given the confidence that I'm actually desirable. I've realized this too late and now I actually sort of believe it too, but in all honesty I don't know what to think.

The reality is that I'm 20 years old and kissless. Sure, I don't meet any new people which is my fault, but surely something should have happened already by this age. Am I making sense?",Anyone else dealing with unrealistic confidence/expectations?,like_log

ForeverAlone,"We all yearn for those friends who we actually resonate with, not the 'social media' superficial friends. The type of friend we can call up at 3am when we need help. The type of friend who stands by us at the highs as well as the lows. This is how to make those friends even after you have left education:

**1) Be yourself.** It's all about vulnerability. It is less about changing yourself to meet the ideals of what you think someone else would like, instead try to be unapologetically yourself and you will attract people who genuinely value you for you.

**2) Be proactive.** Comment on people's Facebook posts or reply to people's [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/) stories - both great way to reconnect with old friends in a direct way.

**3) Use friendship apps.** There are many great apps out there which connect you with new people who are all on there for the same reason. They are open to making friends with you. I have used a lot and my personal favourite is [Serendip](https://serendip.co/) \- it cuts through the superficiality and actually connects you with people who share your values. Others include [Bumble](https://bumble.com/), but it is more used for dating.

**4) Phone calls.** Calling your existing friends is a great way to strengthen your bond. When we can't meet in person due to lockdown, a voice or video call has much more depth than a text message.

**5) Just ask.** This isn't dating, you don't need to worry about being rejected to find the 'one'. Ask people you have just met for a coffee or their number. ""I am new to the area and it would be great if you could show me around"". Put yourself at the receiving end of this - it's a very natural message.

**6) Join local groups.** This is not advised during lockdown! Whilst we are under social isolation we can fall back on #3 for the meanwhile.

Sex was fucking mind blowing and that‚Äôs big for me. We‚Äôve been talking since last summer and we were hooking up every so often and talking to each other a lot and sending loads of nudes and doing so much dirty shit which is sooo big for me, I need all that dirty shit, and I love doin it. Things were good but we were just friends and had an understanding that we are both hooking up with other people, we don‚Äôt mind talking about it and we are also down to have threesomes/orgies, etc.

Anyway, the last few months like December-March things were fading out and he stopped nudes and I could telL he didn‚Äôt desire me anymore.

Is it too much to ask him to talk to me? Why doesn‚Äôt he wanna see me or at least have sex? Guys reject me all the fuckin time and I‚Äôm basically givin it away for free I have zero self respect. Ugh

This doesn't mean ""don't try"" - because I still see a few idiots in this sub who will say ""I'm giving up. I don't care about my job anymore. I'm not working out. Im eating what I want to eat"" - yeah no shit no one wants to be with you now that you are a slob. Although they always get downvoted, they make us all look terrible.

But to everyone else that has to put up with the bullshit of ""learn to love yourself"" - tell them to fuck off. Because its all still bullshit. For me, its literally luck - and there are some unlucky mother fuckers in the world.

This sub was a cool place to vent. It could be unhealthy at times so I've came and went. But realized that now its more positive - people posting success stories and keeping each others heads up. 2-3 years ago it was ""fuck the world. I give up at everything."" Its okay to feel like you will never make it out. Honestly the sad truth is that some people dont. But those that keep other down with them are just as bad as the fake platituders

ForeverAlone,"How are you?

Since my last post *a lot* has happened. I gave up on pursuing the friend of mine I was talking about, and over time my mental health deteriorated so badly I finally took the steps to get antidepressants... Just to have my appointment canceled with two days notice because of the quarantine. I've now given up on that ‚Äì if the medical class gave me the middle finger when I was in need, they're not seeing a penny of my money ‚Äì¬†even though I've been having constant, almost daily suicidal thoughts.

Amidst the quarantine, I found myself talking with that friend of mine a lot more often. We found ourselves texting each other stuff that I would consider flirting if I didn't know the context. ü•∞ and ‚ù§Ô∏è emojis left and right. Interestingly I learned she has body image issues, which shows those things aren't necessarily rational given that she's one of the most attractive people I've ever met. 

As my mental health went haywire during the quarantine (following my worries of being alone forever, and my life being just decades and decades of coming from work to an empty home at 10PM), this ""I don't know what the fuck she wants with me"" thing served as a background. I might have decided to not pursue anything with her, and I really like her as a friend, but I can't understate how much I'd like to hook up with her.

Meanwhile, talking to another friend of mine, I've realized/accepted how my problems also have a ""sexual"" side to them. I've spent too much time dismissing it as haram but I was clearly hurting myself by being a complete prude (I actually think this was a defense mechanism). I've asked a few other friends to not refrain from discussing that kind of thing with me anymore (I used to get really angry over it and consider it always disrespectful). I think that being told so by a woman made all the difference.

I didn't tell this realization to my therapist, but on our last (biweekly, virtual because of the quarantine) session I tried to explain how my mood depended on how hopeful I felt about finding someone (and with college gone, I don't think I have any way to meet women without relying on a really unlikely stroke of luck) and how the situation with my friend served as a background for it ‚Äì increasing instability only because it made me hopeful now and then. I struggled to explain this to her, so she interrupted me and told me I needed to awaken my sexuality. That I overthink ‚Äì I think too much with my head and don't respect what my body tells me.

Then she said she thought I really needed to lose my virginity¬†‚Äì either through sex workers (legal in my country) or by asking a friend for it (she asked if I thought that friend of mine would accept ‚Äî I think maybe, but how the hell could I even introduce that subject lol).

I get where she's coming from. I've always been really risk-averse in relation to relationships/sexual issues. It makes a lot of sense that I'd lose that ""lock"" and start accepting to take more risks. It would also demystify some stuff and make me more comfortable. The logic is really sound.

But it's just that I can't go through with it. Having sex with a prostitute before I ever kissed a girl would a humiliation I took for life. I simply can't ask a my friend if she'd be up to this. It's potentially so disastrous. 

If I go the ""natural way"", it would take years. Given how mentally unstable I've been in the past ~6 months, if *nothing* happens ‚Äì¬†no relationship, no glimpse of hope, I doubt I'll endure more than a year without trying to end my life. The writing on the wall is pretty clear: my life will most likely be one not worth living. If that doesn't change soon, I have no reason to continue.

It gives me control over the things I can't control in my own life, but most importantly, it gives me a chance to be normal and included, even if it's just for a few moments at a time.




It sucks really. We have no control over the parts of our lives that we should, and instead have to be shuffled around in some cosmic gumball machine without consent because two people, who probably had no business creating us in the first place, decided to do so without any serious consideration for how we might turn out.




In my 25 years of this shit, I haven't experienced anything meaningful to justify why I've stuck around this long other than my pesky survival instinct or something I'm looking forward to watching on TV. If I had absolutely any choice in the matter, I would've stayed exactly where tf I was before I was conceived. Being alive is complicated, pleasure and suffering are massively disproportionate, and the world is rampant with inequality. Who in the hell in their right mind would take a gamble on the off chance that this would be an enjoyable experience for their child?",I carry myself through the days by imagining myself as someone else,JediKnightKeylo
ForeverAlone,I‚Äôm sooooooo lonely and it‚Äôs bothering me. I know they say desperation screw people away but it‚Äôs so hard when you‚Äôre so lonely it hurts. I want to be caressed and loved. I want someone to hold me. I want someone to kiss me on the cheek. I want to look into someone‚Äôs eye and feel butterflies.,I want to be in love and be loved so bad,psl001
ForeverAlone,"I've seen a few posts within this past week about how the realization of their FA-ness has turned into anger at some points. I feel like my tolerance for people has significantly dropped recently. I won't be disrespected or have you assuming anything of me and you not being called out for it, even if it was harmless and not intended in that way. 

For example, my mom bought milk from the store earlier this week, and like a few days after that, she randomly asks me why it seems like the milk isn't being used and I get hostile for no reason saying something like, ""I have been drinking the milk! Just because you don't see me using it, doesn't mean I'm not!"" with an irritated tone. I immediately feel bad after acting that way. This is one example but imagine this to other questions or comments directed at me. It's toxic and not fair to others.

My thing is that I am in no way a 'mean' person and me acting in this manner does not ""expose"" the way I truly am, so please don't suggest this. It has nothing to do with that. I just feel that being alone has finally got to me and it never did before like six months ago. Before then, I was comfortably living like this and being who I am but the sudden realization (that led me to weep one gloomy afternoon) that I'm a college junior who has no friends apart from my two roommates who I always hear having fun with their girls from my room, just really broke me from then on. Simply having no one to text, to call or FaceTime, or relate with, takes the already-nonexistent happiness away from me because, isn't a huge part of life about making connections and relationships? I clearly lack both.

I noticed another thing this year. If I laugh at something, it was something from in front of a device, a laptop, or a smartphone. Most people laugh from conversations they have with other people but since I'm practically FA, I am only laughing from something on Twitter, YouTube, Twitch, Netflix, or anything from the internet. I want to have good times with human beings, not just within the small corners of my room in front of a screen, you know?

Do any of you feel, relate, or act even this way sometimes? I'm working on not allowing this loneliness to make me into this jerk that I'm not, just so you know. Thanks.",Do you notice yourself being mean for no reason? (plus a small vent),azontoman
