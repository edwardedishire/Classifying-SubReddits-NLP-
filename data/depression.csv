depression,"Why is it impossible to get help with a deathwish for people who simply dont want to be. You are forced to drag yourself through every day or get medicine and therapy, but why? I have this feeling since im 13, now im turning 26 soon, nothing changed...
I isolated myself around 18 because i see no point in life, no spark of happiness, i simply cant enjoy anything. I dont want a therapy. I want a doctor, who will help me end it painless and in peace. Sure my family will be sad, but i didnt get asked if i wanted this, i dont need anybody to tell me i need to be. 
Im too scared of doing it myself, because it can be horrible painful and a struggle before it ends. We have the medicine and enough doctors who can test you about that.

depression,"So, long story short, I've dealt with social anxiety since I can remember. As a kid, all throughout high school, I didnt talk to anyone outside my immediate family. I kicked it and pretty much turned my life around immediately after high school. No idea if that is relevant at all, but juat establishing I've dealt with depression and anxiety like my whole life.

Fast forward, im now 28 going on 29. Started a new job right before COVID hit. It was going fine, I was a go-getter, always looking to show my great work ethic. In the summer, they tasked me with something that stressed me out to the point where I feel like it broke something inside of me. I broke down crying in front of my boss, and they shifted things around to help me out, and it did help. But since then, I feel like I just have this anxiety at work. And this laziness. Like I just keep putting things off, putting out bare minimum effort, etc. No one has said anything about my work; I still get things done, but like I said, it is just bare minimum now. I don't want to blame the depression incase it is just laziness and I am using it as an excuse. But I know it plays a part. 

I have no idea if it is clinical or not. I've tried a few different medications, all with awful side effects to the point where I quit them within a month. I've tried a program through work where we get free outside counseling sessions. They are helpful to an extent, but they're more just tips and tricks to manage stress and anxiety. 

I haven't felt ""happy"" since I started dating my girlfriend (who is wonderful and patient with this, but I fear my depression affecting our relationship). Even before then, I rarely ever felt truly happy.. I just feel ""meh"" a lot. Some days I feel like I'm going to cry for no damn reason. I want to quit my job. I want to just be lazy.

I don't even know what's the right mindset anymore. just saying that makes me feel like a self-important prick. should I look at depression as a self-prescribed illness? do I struggle because of my own willingness to struggle?

depression,"I'm not sure if this was even the right subreddit to post in, but I wasn't sure what else to do. Growing up I was quiet, shy, nervou, and very scared of what other people thought. I didn't go to parties or have experiences like other young people do, I was pretty withdrawn. I didn't go to my prom, I didn't date, I don't have stories. I grew up hearing of the things other people did, my friends or other people in school were having their first kiss, dating hooking up, going to parties, and having fun without feeling inhibited like me. I've always felt like I missed out, ashamed, and like everyone else got this out of their system when they were young and I never did, but now it's too late, and I don't even know how I would do it. This kind of came to a head in college, I finally got a girlfriend, and did some of these things, but she was far more experienced than me. She described her past as promiscuous, she had stories of hooking up, going to parties, and dating. I never judged her for this, I didn't think it made her less of a person that she'd slept around as she said, but it just pointed out how pathetic my past was. I never did those things, she has experienced them, felt what it was like to be young, and got it out of her system. I never did, and I worry that FOMO messed up our relationship. I just don't know what to do about this now. I'm still not an outgoing person so I don't meet people, I've tried dating apps but they don't work for me , I had them for like a year and a half and never exchanged more than a few messages with someone.

EVERYONE loves him. but i’m his girlfriend.
it’s a different type of relationship; ive ever been in one quite like it.
i guess i’ll just get the point that i don’t wanna say that’s i’m trying to dodge. but yea obviously i have lots of medications i’m supposed to take that i say i take but i don’t i just can’t i just forget honestly. BeCause ALL i can think about and do and talk about and spend my free time doing is smoking weed. at first it was cool and fine but i think it’s taken over my life. i cant think straight anymore. but i cant stop. when i’m high it’s awesome- obviously. but when i’m sober talking to my mom i forget stuff i feel things differently. i feel like my perspective has changed. i’m trapped though. 
my boyfriends nineteen hes a skilled labor worker let’s say that. but he smokes as much as me. that’s what we do. before anything. after anything. during anything. it’s fun but i cant help but worry i’m a overthinker. i’m a dooming overthinker with this gianormous depression wave just sitting on my head and then it’s a tsunami and i want to be dead. 

he gets mean. he gets this way with his words and twists mine and he’s always the victim. and he punches things and breaks mirrors and pushes me around like i’m just in his way. 
but he loves me so sweetly too. or maybe i’m stupid. I CANT TELL BECAUSE EVERYONE THINKS HES AMAZING AND HE JUST SAYS ITS ANGER ISSUES. we’ve been together for a year. we “live” in a little “apartment” ( i call it a shed) with no bathroom or shower. we have to walk in his moms house for that. and this said apartment  is filthy. that’s all i’m going to say. but i’m trapped. i’m a waitress. dropped out of college. i just want to cry honestly i feel like my life is going nowhere i want to cry in my moms lap and just disappear and cry forever. i feel so alone all the time because he always hangs out with his friends and i just have no life. 
i want to end it but i don’t i just want to move to florida and start over and lay on the beach and cry but i cant. does this make sense. probably not. please don’t attack me. i have th worst social anxiety i wish i could be like everyone else. i just am spinning in circles and spiraling. also i need to mention i have the worst bpd. thats another story.",completely lost,Background-Region-80

depression,"2 years of soul searching after an adolescence of hellish, sleep-walking depression and I'm very aware of what I'd like to do in life. But its only made things harder for me. Putting one foot in front of the other ends up with me falling and eating shit over and over. I don't even have consistent bad habits. My life is in no way static or repetitive. I try to get healthy, try to write music, try mental health treatment, try to pass my college classes. And I've failed at all of them 4 or 5 times each. At work I change up my work style just to keep things from being monotonous. I even adopt different personas and try to practice being confident a lot. I just never can make anything stick. It always ends up with me for the next few months stuck in bed and depressed and barely surviving. Then I kick it back into gear, one thing at a time but fail. 

I wan't to create things. Most likely music or educational content or movies. But really anything to change the world. It's my true dream and I get goosebumps when I brainstorm ideas. But I need like... an ammanuenis, or an assistant because I have no way of getting those ideas out with all of my mental illness and physical ailments. 

Some people don't believe in themselves at all. I think (don't call me arrogant), I occasionally have world changing ideas and bursts of creativity. I have a strong visual imagination and I'm good at understanding the balance that goes into a succesful project. Sometimes I will sit down and think for hours about a play, or an song, or a movie, or a lecture. And how I could make something inspiring and enjoyable for people. But while I'm thinking I can only speak it. Writing it down feels exhausting, my musical proficiency is meh on instruments but I know composition. It's like theres a force stopping me from letting the ideas flow. I've had people become amazed at my ideas, but usually they are fleeting and I just spew them out and then forget them.

depression,"I don’t expect anyone to have the answers here I mostly just want to get it out of my system as I have no one else I can really talk to.

I work at two hospitals, I just started at the second one in February after my first job started hiring way more people than we need. The new job seemed flashy (nicer facility, an open gym in an area where all gyms are locked down, not run down like my first job)

Both places said they’d work with me to make my schedule work for both jobs, however the schedule is really not working for me.

I was depressed before all this. Long story short went through a bad breakup after an emotionally abusive relationship where I was isolated from friends and family then right into a hospital job as the pandemic started which meant while my friends would make a bubble with others and break rules to hangout I was always excluded due to work.

My attitude kept getting worse and worse which probably exacerbated the problem and I started abusing medications as the only means to feel better.

In January I sought help for my addiction issues and started on an opiate replacement and am slowly tapering off of anti anxiety meds, things seemed better. When I got my second job I was excited that I was able to put my mind to it and make things happen.

In between my training and starting my second job the promise of extra income helped relieve some stress and I started investing in a few hobbies. 

Fast forward to now and my second job has me in only on overnights on weekends. Despite saying they’d schedule me every other weekend they give me every weekend which is frustrating my original employer. There are times where I’m scheduled for 3 shifts in 24 hours.

The only person I had helping me at work is now on leave because her father died and the people stepping in for her have the attitude of “too bad” if I’m scheduled to work 48 hours straight and I spend half my time trying to hunt down someone to take one of my shifts.

I have no time for any hobbies I feel like I barely have time to take care of my dog let alone myself and I’m constantly exhausted. I’ve relapsed a few times despite the meds I’m on making it feel like crap when I do.

I know the obvious solution is to quit my second job (it’s farther, pays slightly less, I have less seniority) but my original job gives everything based off seniority so whenever I try to get more shifts or a fulltime spot someone who’s been in another department just snags it. Performance doesn’t seem to matter either.

Add to that management is blatant about not giving a shit if we get sick to the point of mocking those of us who wear n95’s and I just feel hopeless.

I feel like a rat stuck in a wheel. I spend most nights crying about the relationship I should be over by now and crying over feeling trapped in my work then eventually falling asleep and waking up sad.

On my days off now I just lay in bed with my dog and watch tv instead of doing any of the things I find rewarding.

I really want to quit the second job, but my old work keeps hiring more and more people even when we say we need more shifts so I feel as though I’ll quit it just to go back to struggling financially. At the same time though this doesn’t feel worth it.",Depressed when I don’t work but getting even more depressed working non stop,Throwaway2transdude
depression,"I'm hoping there's someone out there that has experienced this exact feeling that I'm having and has had some way of getting through it. I go through bouts of this:

The moment I wake up in the morning, I have this horrible feeling of dread. There's no rhyme or reason to it. I may or may not have had a disturbing or anxiety-ridden dream. I may have slept through the night (which generally doesn't happen without medication (over-the-counter sleeping pills, Benedryl, muscle relaxers, Xanax, etc.) or I may have slept 1-2 hours. I may have had the best day of my life the day before or I may have had someone close to me pass away. This specific feeling will all but disappear once I get out of bed, but no matter how many times I tell myself to just get up the moment I'm awake, I can't just jump out of bed. I'm frozen. There are days I wake up several times and manage to fall back to sleep, but the feeling is there each time my eyes pop open. For the most part, my mind is NOT racing.

When I'm on the meds, I'm pretty sure I've NEVER had this feeling. HOWEVER, I have a love-hate relationship with my meds. They work amazingly to suppress my depression and anxiety, almost immediately even though most are supposed to take months to start working. The flip-side (and I believe it's all related) is that I experience the majority of the side effects and they become overwhelming fairly quickly. Even worse, I begin to feel absolutely nothing.

alright so i don't even know where to start. i've been having really severe existential dread type of feelings for the past few months and it's eating me up inside. just the thought that we really don't matter and most of us are going to be forgotten soon after we die. the thought that after we die, all that's left of us are the memories and when they're forgotten, there's basically nothing left. the thought of dying and that it's impossible to escape death. the paranoia of going outside because you could die at any minute. the thought of my parents eventually passing away. the thought that nothing truly matters. also i'm really socially anxious, my palms get all sweaty before meeting people, i even get anxious when accepting a food delivery. i didn't use to be like this, i don't know what happened. i'm still glad i have a few friends left. i used to be a total asshole because i was angry at everyone and everything and a couple weeks or months ago i finally understood why my old friends didn't want to be friends with me anymore. i'm not such an asshole anymore now, mainly because i keep all the anger bottled up inside of me all the time. i'm happier now than i was before though, because i don't hurt people close to me anymore. i used to be a total asshole to my parents as well but now i'm not but i still feel extremely guilty for all the times i have been. i'm really not looking forward to the end of quarantine, because that means i will be supposed to go to school in person again and talk to people and endure all of the noises and meaningless conversations again. my grades really improved since the start of quarantine because i could finally focus on my studies. i fell in love with physics, math and programming and i enjoy it now but i can't stop thinking about how meaningless all of it is. i also get really anxious when i have to attend my lithuanian (mother language) classes because we have to write essays and shit like that but i'm extremely bad at it because my head is empty and i have no idea what to write about. because of that i skip all my assignments from that class and i basically have an F or D in that class in american grades. all my other classes are going pretty well though. my math and lithuanian teachers are also both huge assholes and they think they're for some reason better than the students they teach, even though most of us are 'adults' now since most of us are 18 now. i quit nicotine so i've got that going for me. i'm addicted to weed though because it temporarily solves my problems so that's not perfect. i probably should see a psychiatrist or someone regarding all of this but i'm scared to because i've had numerous horrible experiences with psychiatrists before and that's what started all of this. i don't know what this post is, i just wanted to vent and let out my anger. im 18 by the way if that matters. thanks for the replies if there are any.",my life is a complete mess and i don't know where to even begin fixing it,notdoingwell123123

depression,"So I've had this job for about 2-3 years now. 
At first I got along very well with my co workers and managers, but when the place started to get busy I was overloaded with ridiculous hours and no breaks.

I would be expected to work a 12 hour shift until 3-4am and then come back in at 11am to work the lunch shift.  I made barely enough money to scrape by, and had constant beratings from others. 
It got to the point where the first lockdown made me ECSTATIC because I finally had time to relax. I actually engaged in my hobbies and interests, I saw people I care about and had some wonderful days and nights out. I was actually happy. 
Then as soon as my work place reopened, I was back to work and had absolutely no time for any form of life outside of work. My hobbies, interests and friends/family were immediately dropped again because even when I had a day off, I was too mentally drained to do anything other than lay in bed on my phone all day.

I've had to sacrifice a shocking amounts of sleep, meals and showers for this job. During the second and 3rd lockdowns I could barely engage in things that made me happy because I was simply stewing in anxiety and dread about going back. 
Every time I went back I'd have one of my managers expecting me to be happy I can work again, but he has no idea just how much this job has destroyed me.
Even if the hours weren't long, busy shifts would be full of customers and Co workers shouting and cussing at me, and I've lost count of the amount of shifts I've had to hide in the back because I was panicking or crying so much.

I've now handed in my notice, I will be leaving this job at the end of this week. I'm absolutely terrified for my financial situation as I have no other job lined up and the amount of money I make from this job is actually insulting, it won't even get me through a week at this rate.

depression,"“Capitalist realism insists on treating mental health as if it were a natural fact, like weather (but, then again, weather is no longer a natural fact so much as a political-economic effect). In the 1960s and 1970s, radical theory and politics (Laing, Foucault, Deleuze and Guattari, etc.) coalesced around extreme mental conditions such as schizophrenia, arguing, for instance, that madness was not a natural, but a political, category. But what is needed now is a politicization of much more common disorders. Indeed, it is their very commonness which is the issue: in Britain, depression is now the condition that is most treated by the NHS. In his book The Selfish Capitalist, Oliver James has convincingly posited a correlation between rising rates of mental distress and the neoliberal mode of capitalism practiced in countries like Britain, the USA and Australia. In line with James’s claims, I want to argue that it is necessary to reframe the growing problem of stress (and distress) in capitalist societies. Instead of treating it as incumbent on individuals to resolve their own psychological distress, instead, that is, of accepting the vast privatization of stress that has taken place over the last thirty years, we need to ask: how has it become acceptable that so many people, and especially so many young people, are ill?”

When I was 16, college, no friends anymore but still did well academically.

I'm still as depressed as ever. Tried antidepressants, but the side effects were too much - I have a physical job.

depression,"So, long story short, I've dealt with social anxiety since I can remember. As a kid, all throughout high school, I didnt talk to anyone outside my immediate family. I kicked it and pretty much turned my life around immediately after high school. No idea if that is relevant at all, but juat establishing I've dealt with depression and anxiety like my whole life.

Fast forward, im now 28 going on 29. Started a new job right before COVID hit. It was going fine, I was a go-getter, always looking to show my great work ethic. In the summer, they tasked me with something that stressed me out to the point where I feel like it broke something inside of me. I broke down crying in front of my boss, and they shifted things around to help me out, and it did help. But since then, I feel like I just have this anxiety at work. And this laziness. Like I just keep putting things off, putting out bare minimum effort, etc. No one has said anything about my work; I still get things done, but like I said, it is just bare minimum now. I don't want to blame the depression incase it is just laziness and I am using it as an excuse. But I know it plays a part. 

I have no idea if it is clinical or not. I've tried a few different medications, all with awful side effects to the point where I quit them within a month. I've tried a program through work where we get free outside counseling sessions. They are helpful to an extent, but they're more just tips and tricks to manage stress and anxiety. 

I haven't felt ""happy"" since I started dating my girlfriend (who is wonderful and patient with this, but I fear my depression affecting our relationship). Even before then, I rarely ever felt truly happy.. I just feel ""meh"" a lot. Some days I feel like I'm going to cry for no damn reason. I want to quit my job. I want to just be lazy.

I never judged her for this, I didn't think it made her less of a person that she'd slept around as she said, but it just pointed out how pathetic my past was.

EVERYONE loves him. but i’m his girlfriend.
it’s a different type of relationship; ive ever been in one quite like it.
i guess i’ll just get the point that i don’t wanna say that’s i’m trying to dodge. but yea obviously i have lots of medications i’m supposed to take that i say i take but i don’t i just can’t i just forget honestly. BeCause ALL i can think about and do and talk about and spend my free time doing is smoking weed. at first it was cool and fine but i think it’s taken over my life. i cant think straight anymore. but i cant stop. when i’m high it’s awesome- obviously. but when i’m sober talking to my mom i forget stuff i feel things differently. i feel like my perspective has changed. i’m trapped though.

he gets mean. he gets this way with his words and twists mine and he’s always the victim. and he punches things and breaks mirrors and pushes me around like i’m just in his way. 
but he loves me so sweetly too. or maybe i’m stupid. I CANT TELL BECAUSE EVERYONE THINKS HES AMAZING AND HE JUST SAYS ITS ANGER ISSUES. we’ve been together for a year. we “live” in a little “apartment” ( i call it a shed) with no bathroom or shower. we have to walk in his moms house for that. and this said apartment  is filthy. that’s all i’m going to say. but i’m trapped. i’m a waitress. dropped out of college. i just want to cry honestly i feel like my life is going nowhere i want to cry in my moms lap and just disappear and cry forever. i feel so alone all the time because he always hangs out with his friends and i just have no life. 
i want to end it but i don’t i just want to move to florida and start over and lay on the beach and cry but i cant. does this make sense. probably not. please don’t attack me. i have th worst social anxiety i wish i could be like everyone else. i just am spinning in circles and spiraling. also i need to mention i have the worst bpd. thats another story.",completely lost,Background-Region-80

I try to get healthy, try to write music, try mental health treatment, try to pass my college classes. And I've failed at all of them 4 or 5 times each. At work I change up my work style just to keep things from being monotonous. I even adopt different personas and try to practice being confident a lot. I just never can make anything stick. It always ends up with me for the next few months stuck in bed and depressed and barely surviving. Then I kick it back into gear, one thing at a time but fail. 

I wan't to create things. Most likely music or educational content or movies. But really anything to change the world. It's my true dream and I get goosebumps when I brainstorm ideas. But I need like... an ammanuenis, or an assistant because I have no way of getting those ideas out with all of my mental illness and physical ailments.

depression,"I don’t expect anyone to have the answers here I mostly just want to get it out of my system as I have no one else I can really talk to.

I work at two hospitals, I just started at the second one in February after my first job started hiring way more people than we need. The new job seemed flashy (nicer facility, an open gym in an area where all gyms are locked down, not run down like my first job)

Both places said they’d work with me to make my schedule work for both jobs, however the schedule is really not working for me.

I was depressed before all this. Long story short went through a bad breakup after an emotionally abusive relationship where I was isolated from friends and family then right into a hospital job as the pandemic started which meant while my friends would make a bubble with others and break rules to hangout I was always excluded due to work.

My attitude kept getting worse and worse which probably exacerbated the problem and I started abusing medications as the only means to feel better.

In January I sought help for my addiction issues and started on an opiate replacement and am slowly tapering off of anti anxiety meds, things seemed better. When I got my second job I was excited that I was able to put my mind to it and make things happen.

In between my training and starting my second job the promise of extra income helped relieve some stress and I started investing in a few hobbies. 

Fast forward to now and my second job has me in only on overnights on weekends. Despite saying they’d schedule me every other weekend they give me every weekend which is frustrating my original employer. There are times where I’m scheduled for 3 shifts in 24 hours.

The only person I had helping me at work is now on leave because her father died and the people stepping in for her have the attitude of “too bad” if I’m scheduled to work 48 hours straight and I spend half my time trying to hunt down someone to take one of my shifts.

I have no time for any hobbies I feel like I barely have time to take care of my dog let alone myself and I’m constantly exhausted. I’ve relapsed a few times despite the meds I’m on making it feel like crap when I do.

I know the obvious solution is to quit my second job (it’s farther, pays slightly less, I have less seniority) but my original job gives everything based off seniority so whenever I try to get more shifts or a fulltime spot someone who’s been in another department just snags it. Performance doesn’t seem to matter either.

Add to that management is blatant about not giving a shit if we get sick to the point of mocking those of us who wear n95’s and I just feel hopeless.

I feel like a rat stuck in a wheel. I spend most nights crying about the relationship I should be over by now and crying over feeling trapped in my work then eventually falling asleep and waking up sad.

On my days off now I just lay in bed with my dog and watch tv instead of doing any of the things I find rewarding.

I really want to quit the second job, but my old work keeps hiring more and more people even when we say we need more shifts so I feel as though I’ll quit it just to go back to struggling financially. At the same time though this doesn’t feel worth it.",Depressed when I don’t work but getting even more depressed working non stop,Throwaway2transdude
depression,"I'm hoping there's someone out there that has experienced this exact feeling that I'm having and has had some way of getting through it. I go through bouts of this:

The moment I wake up in the morning, I have this horrible feeling of dread. There's no rhyme or reason to it. I may or may not have had a disturbing or anxiety-ridden dream. I may have slept through the night (which generally doesn't happen without medication (over-the-counter sleeping pills, Benedryl, muscle relaxers, Xanax, etc.) or I may have slept 1-2 hours. I may have had the best day of my life the day before or I may have had someone close to me pass away. This specific feeling will all but disappear once I get out of bed, but no matter how many times I tell myself to just get up the moment I'm awake, I can't just jump out of bed. I'm frozen. There are days I wake up several times and manage to fall back to sleep, but the feeling is there each time my eyes pop open. For the most part, my mind is NOT racing.

When I'm on the meds, I'm pretty sure I've NEVER had this feeling. HOWEVER, I have a love-hate relationship with my meds. They work amazingly to suppress my depression and anxiety, almost immediately even though most are supposed to take months to start working. The flip-side (and I believe it's all related) is that I experience the majority of the side effects and they become overwhelming fairly quickly. Even worse, I begin to feel absolutely nothing.

depression,"So I've had this job for about 2-3 years now. 
At first I got along very well with my co workers and managers, but when the place started to get busy I was overloaded with ridiculous hours and no breaks.

I would be expected to work a 12 hour shift until 3-4am and then come back in at 11am to work the lunch shift.  I made barely enough money to scrape by, and had constant beratings from others. 
It got to the point where the first lockdown made me ECSTATIC because I finally had time to relax. I actually engaged in my hobbies and interests, I saw people I care about and had some wonderful days and nights out. I was actually happy. 
Then as soon as my work place reopened, I was back to work and had absolutely no time for any form of life outside of work. My hobbies, interests and friends/family were immediately dropped again because even when I had a day off, I was too mentally drained to do anything other than lay in bed on my phone all day.

I've had to sacrifice a shocking amounts of sleep, meals and showers for this job. During the second and 3rd lockdowns I could barely engage in things that made me happy because I was simply stewing in anxiety and dread about going back. 
Every time I went back I'd have one of my managers expecting me to be happy I can work again, but he has no idea just how much this job has destroyed me.
Even if the hours weren't long, busy shifts would be full of customers and Co workers shouting and cussing at me, and I've lost count of the amount of shifts I've had to hide in the back because I was panicking or crying so much.

I've now handed in my notice, I will be leaving this job at the end of this week. I'm absolutely terrified for my financial situation as I have no other job lined up and the amount of money I make from this job is actually insulting, it won't even get me through a week at this rate.

depression,"“Capitalist realism insists on treating mental health as if it were a natural fact, like weather (but, then again, weather is no longer a natural fact so much as a political-economic effect). In the 1960s and 1970s, radical theory and politics (Laing, Foucault, Deleuze and Guattari, etc.) coalesced around extreme mental conditions such as schizophrenia, arguing, for instance, that madness was not a natural, but a political, category. But what is needed now is a politicization of much more common disorders. Indeed, it is their very commonness which is the issue: in Britain, depression is now the condition that is most treated by the NHS. In his book The Selfish Capitalist, Oliver James has convincingly posited a correlation between rising rates of mental distress and the neoliberal mode of capitalism practiced in countries like Britain, the USA and Australia. In line with James’s claims, I want to argue that it is necessary to reframe the growing problem of stress (and distress) in capitalist societies. Instead of treating it as incumbent on individuals to resolve their own psychological distress, instead, that is, of accepting the vast privatization of stress that has taken place over the last thirty years, we need to ask: how has it become acceptable that so many people, and especially so many young people, are ill?”

Got a job in a factory, made enough to rent a house way too big for one person, became an alcoholic. Quit that job and alcohol, now I have a more flexible job and I am studying part-time.

There is only the chase of bettering yourself and figuring out who you are. ""What more fun, wild, adventurous thing to chase in life than yourself? 

So much of my life I've been trying to decide to be one thing. I thought that I could only have one career or that there was only one path I could take. I'm 22, fresh out of college and completely lost during this pandemic. There has been endless pressure from people asking what I'm going to do and who I'm going to be. I've had way too much time on my hands which I've spent healing old traumas instead of advancing my career. I am still trying to figure out who I am and I have spent most of my life trying so hard to have the perfect body, face, GPA, personality, etc.  I was simultaneously afraid of being too much and not enough. Because of this, I could never make any decisions. I've been at a standstill with my life for over a year now. 

I am trying to unlearn these habits and thoughts as I just have now realized, whatever goal body, goal job, goal whatever I had, I'm never going to get. Even if I did, then I'll just want something better. 

I don't have to be one type of person. There are multiple versions of myself and I can be all of them.

You can struggle and preform. 

I find so much comfort knowing that there is not finish line. No one great thing I have to accomplish. Most people don't ever accomplish anything great.

They usually come and go and when they went i felt really really good again. Well my most recent episode doesnt seem to be going anywhere and im concerned. Its been almost 2 years now being stuck in this funk. I have no motivation, drive, ENERGY!!!!!!!!! When i would read the definition of depression and see ""loses interest in things they normally enjoy"" i didnt rlly believe it till it happened to me. Ive been to so many parties, vacations and events over these last 2 years that id normally LOVEEE but going to them was draining. I have no desire for them at all, which i thought would never happen. WHY WAS I SAD ON A BEAUTIFUL ISLAND IT MAKES NO SENSE I JUST WANT HELP. Anyways... the vampire thing.
I feel like my family notices a change in me but theyre very mean about it. I used to keep my room super clean and organized but ever since these 2 years its been a mess. Clothes everywhere,snacks, garbage etc. i also have these blinds on my windows that completely black out the room. As you can guess i keep those blinds closed 24/7 now. Im always in the dark. My family even comes in sometimes like ""hahaha wow ur such a vampire "" ""let some light in here"" "" EWWW ur rooms so messy clean it!"" i laugh it off but idk. Also my mom keeps telling me to clean my room its so disgusting blah blah blah but after she tells me that i cry. NEVER in front of her of course. I cant even hug my mom so that wouldnt happen. Its not like i dont wanna hug her.. i do but whenever i do its like a fake hug u give to ur friends or something you know. I wish she cared enough to see that the reason why im in the dark, messy room is because im so depressed that i think about killing myself multiple times a week. Idk its not her fault obvi but i get so sad when my family thinks of me as a lazy slob and thats all.

I've battled my depression for years now but I seemed to be managing to survive at least semi-decently. I mean, I was taking care of my hygiene and keeping my space somewhat clean and things like that but I've always treated my body like garbage.

Since he passed I've gone from being numb to straight up not caring about anything. It takes a lot of energy to just force myself to shower, shave and brush my teeth. I can only do it by shaming myself about how disgusting I'll be if I don't.

Beyond that I don't want to do anything at all. I just want to either lay in bed or just stuff my face and play video games all day. I'm filled with regrets and I know many people have those when they lose their loved ones. 

Over the past decade I feel like I've become a person that I could never be proud of. I regret not doing anything about it before he passed but I have zero drive to change my life in any way.

I don't just mean physically either but emotionally with my beliefs as well. I'm a 36(F) year old who has always had serious bouts of depression since the age of 15. I should mention that my parents were never together and basically my father had court obligation to pick me up on the weekends as a child. He was a sick man which I won't get into but I wish he was never my father. My childhood was not the best but it wasn't the worst either. I was always the child who was playing by herself, not because I wanted to be alone but because I either had no friends or my parents never made an attempt to find me playmates. Neither of my parents are close to their own relatives so I don't know or have no bond with my aunts, uncles, cousins or any relatives from either side. My sisters, one step and one half, always had friends to hang out with and when their friends came over it was as if I was the obligation that they should invite me to play too. My parents called me the ""good child"" because I never caused trouble and I was mostly quiet and to myself. I honestly wish an adult would have made the effort to teach me how to socialize and maintain friendships. I was always into video games even as a very young girl, 4 or 5 years old and growing up it was difficult finding other girls who liked games (JRPGS, horror, and adventure mostly) on the same level that I did. It's not just passing free time for me but I have a genuine love for the fantasy, story, characters, and much more that makes it more than just a game.

I can’t shower and take care of myself. I find it hard to get the motivation to do anything. My parents often point it out, which makes me more insecure about myself and more like a burden to them.

I’d love to get a sliver of good every once in a while but I should know that’s impossible at this point. Where was that motivation I had last year? I was doing okay all things considered but i’ve just spiraled down into my nice little hole of sadness and laziness.

depression,"So I am not sure if it's anxiety or depression, and I've tried to get in to see a therapist but it's difficult with my schedule and their time frame

But, recently when sitting in class I get irritated, can't sit still, and barley focus what the teacher is saying

I find it difficult to really enjoy things for long periods of time, video games get boring after a small amount of game play, TV shows don't seem interesting, and all I wanna do is lay in bed - which I know is bad so I force myself to go my living area and sit at my computer to do school work...which ends up scrolling reddit for hours - 

Worse...if I meet someone I'm interested in my brain just goes wild...trying to keep my thoughts rational and sane - they are busy, to they are avoiding you, to they are working, or they have something else to do : cause I know what I'm thinking is wrong, and also pointless cause I mean....why do I care? Like I haven't even gone a date yet, just texting - why is my brain doing this - but I literally cannot keep it out of my mind, which then spirals into a thought process of how I'm horrible for thinking this stuff when I have no reason to have these thoughts or feeling 

It just all comes and goes, some days I'm fine, others I'm not. And it's impossible to see a therapist cause I work full time, and go to school full time - but I can't keep up with these thought processes - I am not suicidal though -

So I’m 18 and I’ve never understood depression. I have friends who’ve been depressed, and I was always there for them to let it all out and provide motivation. I did everything, but I never got the idea of depression. I’ve been through my fair share of shitty situations (druggie parents, bullying, weight loss, etc) but I always saw that brighter side. I used to alway bounce back, joke around, and move on. Nothing ever stuck; I always got up

This Tuesday was Ivy day, the day all the ivies (group of colleges such as Harvard, Yale, Princeton, etc) release all their decisions.

So here’s who I used to be: I was the motivational and optimistic kid,but I was also determined. I worked my ass off for a 4.0 GPA, 1590 SAT, 36 ACT, clubs, volunteering, everything. I’ve won 2 international competitions. I spent months on my college essays. They were the best parts of me; the parts of me that I wanted to grow. The essays were me and the person I aspire to be.

My decision was mid December, my dream school: Stanford. Rejected... not even fucking deferred. 

I was sad, but oh well, it would be fine. I still had other applications and I could just improve on my Stanford app. I just had to fix it up 

Next, UChicago ED2, rejected. Then CalTech, MIT, Rice, etc. All waitlists/rejections. Sure I cried, but the next morning, I bounced right back.

So there it was, 4/6. Ivy day. Tuesday... my last hope. I was optimistic, I knew all I had were rejected/waitlisted but fuck it I had hope

They aren’t kidding when they say it’s the hope that kills you. 

*Yale rejected. Harvard rejected. Columbia rejected. Penn rejected. Princeton rejected.*

I cried myself to sleep that night. I feel fucking worthless. I feel deluded. I feel like shit. I feel dead. All this work in my life was for a fucking “we reject to inform you” from every fucking school

Yes I get colleges aren’t the end of rejection, and all sorts of rejections are in store. Hell I was rejected from tons of stuff before, but I never gave up and always kept trying. First year I didn’t even get to the state competition in a club. The next year, I tried again and still didn’t get past districts. The third year, I gave my best and won fucking internationals. Number one in the world—all bc I didn’t lose hope and kept trying. But these rejections broke me, and I don’t even know why

I’ve never been close to depression, but now the flood gates have opened. 18 years of bullshit is all coming out. My first breakup, the people making fun of me, my own bad choices, my stupid fucking fears. Hell I don’t even know who the fuck I am.

I had this idea that I was someone who’d do something. I was going to get out of my shitty neighborhood. I was going to make a difference. There was an idea of me, my friends, family, family friends, all knew the me who would get out and do something with their life.

Since then, I haven’t been to school. I haven’t had more than one meal in a day. I haven’t showered. I haven’t brushed my teeth. I haven’t done fucking anything.

depression,"I watched that movie again last night. It finally came to Netflix Canada. Its been a long time. I remember it being sad,  but beautiful. 

I was a little worried that watching it while in such a terrible depression would make me feel worse, reinforce the wrong kind of thinking. I've gotten so far down the ladder lately that I've been having episodes of derealization. 

I was wrong about that, it was exactly what I needed to see right now. The visuals were as beautiful as I remember they were, and the messaging was like a balm. How they represent depression and the hell it puts you through is just so real,  and unlike any other portrayal. There's no judgement, just honesty. Depression is not a failing, and it's very, very difficult to pull yourself out. 

“Everyone's hell is different. It's not all fire and pain. The real hell is your life gone wrong.”

Loneliness, despair, fear, pain, grief, doubt, self pity, anger, jealousy, hopelessness, betrayal, confusion, loss, I can't stand you! Get away from me. I leave the room when you're talking, I can't stand your complaining. I hate you. Stop talking to me. You make me so mad I want to hit you. You're so stupid. Dumb cunt. Are you retarded? You say the dumbest shit. You're the worst thing that's ever happened to me. I hope your next boyfriend beats you. You stupid cunt. 

all competing in my head nonstop. I'm creating my own hell every day, loops of negativity, over and over, waiting for something positive to break through. I'm alone with my thoughts in the broken, dim, empty house. The only difference is I have no soul mate to help me out of it. There is no help coming for me. I have no one left.

So I have to find a way to visualize my heaven. I'm already in a hell of my making,  I need to somehow do the opposite. I need to drag myself out of hell, out of my own head. If im capable of allowing negativity to run rampant in my mind,  it should be possible to do the same with happy thoughts. 

I just don't know how to start yet. All I know is I have to find a way. I think this thought might be my start.  I want to feel happy, safe,  and secure again.

Kids was most likely working as a errand boy and grew up without educational achievements, usually every shack (house) has at least 3-4 generation of family with 10 maximum of childrens, family planning is not really a thing for those thick headed families, malnourished kids and even adults are seen every corner you look, everyone is striving to survive stealing or robbing is common, even eating a pet like dogs, cats, etc. even ""pagpag"" a leftover foods from restaurants usually found to a dumpsters or garbage sites ""pagpag"" means to shake off the dust and collect the edible portion of the food to eat.

Been depressed for over 15 years now. Thought I was managing it well till the pandemic and the lockdown in my country brought so many issues out of the woodwork that led to me been kicked out of my family's house and moving in with my then-fwb, now-gf. Started working at a startup and found that by working myself to the bone, I could deal with alot of the pain and dark days. Turned out to be a temporary measure as at my work I got rewarded for the hard work with more work (no increase in pay but triple the responsibilities) and eventually I couldn't deal with it again. No appetite, chronic insomnia, heart palpitations and a wierd anxiety-driven ulcer. Broke down at 2am one morning. Kept crying and couldn't stop. Felt so pathetic and hopeless, so I quit and tried to spend a few weeks trying to get my head in order. Got a new job but quit that one too after I couldn't get over the burnout. Didn't help that my now-gf started texting a new guy (and went off for drinks with him without telling me they were at his place all night). Felt shattered and invalidated when I brought my objections about the meet and the sneakiness in her approach.

Now back in my mum's house for a breather but I feel like my life is going nowhere fast. Feel like I can't hold a job, can't hold a relationship (like I'm inadequate for her now that the funds are tight), can't bring myself to trust her (apparently I was insecure and should know she won't sleep around), can't talk to family (they are dealing with their own health problems and I provide them support), and can't see a way out of this darkness... Not a peek of light. I've applied for a number of roles but have only gotten a call back for a company that I've worked with and despised (toxic work environment). 

I feel like I've failed in all aspects of my life. I don't think I have the strength to continue to my next birthday. I have worked with the hope that things will get better but 15 years is a lot of time to rely on that (out of fumes even). I feel the tears coming now but can't cry them out. I care about my gf a lot but feel so alone... No money for therapy either. 

I want to ask what to do but I know there are no easy fixes. Not even sure I want a fix. I just want to close my eyes and not have to open them anymore.

depression,"TLDR: I needed to vent about the factors that makes me hate myself. I stopped talking to my friends and family about this stuff so I decided to why not expose myself to strangers in the internet.

I always feel more comfortable venting to people who doesn't know me in real life.

Hi, I'm a 17 year old with diagnosed depression, now that's out of the way, I hope my age doesn't invalidate my experiences.

So I'm currently experiencing the aftermath of something traumatic that has happened in my life, I kept on thinking that I shouldn't be sad because clearly, I'm still a kid and I have yet to experience life. That mindset was so toxic that I started bullying myself for feeling bad. 

I have to admit, I have always been insecure and I decided to get to the roots of why I feel that way. I noticed a lot of stuff that I perceived to be normal until I realized that it was bullshit. I have always been told to give up when things go messy, told to stop crying when I have breakdowns, and constantly told that I was getting fatter. These were the roots of why I belittle myself everyday.

I have low self-esteem, I am weak willed and I have always set expectations low when it comes to myself. I always think that aiming low will make me less disappointed in myself whenever I fail. I wanted to become invisible, to live my life unnoticed. I never thought of myself as remarkable.

Now I repress my emotions despite knowing full to well that it isn't healthy, I was told that my parents are proud of me that I am ""not"" depressed but when I do have breakdowns, I get scolded and told to stop crying. Why was I scolded? It's actually a fault of mine, ever since the pandemic, I had to go through these dreadful online check ups. School started and I used that as a scapegoat to not show up on my appointments till I stopped altogether. I wanted to go back, to start improving once again but I was ashamed. I was starting to open up about my feelings last year, I even came out as an asexual (although many doesn't quite understand what that is). I was talking to my family and my friends whenever I feel like shit until I stopped.  I still do talk about my feelings but it turned into deleted messages before anyone else could reply. I was ashamed of my feelings.

Then my self image comes crashing down. I know that I'm a bit overweight but here in Asia, I'm a full on a fatty. When I was trying to get back on track with my life, I started exercising to lose the weight I gained until I started going back to my unmotivated ways. I get constantly compared with my sister who lost a lot of weight during the pandemic and honestly, my parents are just trying to push me to do better. My mind turns these things into nasty ways to belittle myself, constantly punishing myself for basically... Being depressed.

Self hate kept me from feeling happy. After a fun day, I'd probably cry myself to sleep thinking I don't deserve it. 

I felt like I was a debbie downer whenever open up about my depression. I'd like to think that my friends are always busy so that I shouldn't bother them with my baggage. Although there was a time I said that I was feeling like shit, I don't want to talk about why I feel that way but I just needed to talk to my friends to cheer me up a bit. I was left on read and I went on this pathetic pity party till I can face them again with a smile.

I wanted therapy instead of just receiving pills to numb my emotions but that costs a lot.

I couldn't cry nor could I use words to explain so I just drew until I found my peace. 

But today it was the second or third time this happened, but during the fight, I being the bystander just felt so overwhelmed and angry and sad and self destructive. If I was a rocket I probably launched right off at the spot. My mother pulled the Knife and threaten card. She did this a lot when she was angry. She took out a knife and it was my last straw. My father made her drop the knife but perhaps it's just everything accumulated from the past I cried hysterically. She kept egging on to her own anger saying she should just leave and let us live like a ""happy"" family, then she kept screaming. Mind you we just moved, and her screaming just made me panic too. I want normal in life, not crazy. But right there and then I snapped. It was as if my  body wasn't mine. I walk towards her tearing my hair out and cried while hyperventilating and frantically scratched both my arms( I do this Idk why maybe it's my way to retraining myself??). I held her by both shoulders and told her to pretty much stop it and shut up. 

I was shaking and crying and literally wanted to die at the spot. At that moment I felt like my body wasn't mine.

""How did my life get here?"", ""Why am I like this"", ""Why do I hate myself?"", ""My life's not bad why must I be like this?"", etc etc. All sorts of answers raddle around in my head, but in all honesty I'm not sure how true the answers are. Sometime I wish I just didn't exist, but I'm scared of dying. In fact that's a part of the thing that causes depression and anxiety for me. I'm scared something is wrong with me always wrong with me. My breathing hasnt felt right I've gone to the doctor, and they say I'm fine. When do I accept this. When can I accept it. Why do I not feel like its okay?   


Everyday I feel like my breathing is off I can't describe it better then that. Sometimes I feel like I wont be able to move, breathe, talk, and think. I can of course or I would have been to the hospital. How do I break this cycle I'm scared I'm going to die young like my father yet I can't seem to take proper care of myself. I'm already on anti depressants. I guess I can up them again, but then its harder to sleep.   


I hate myself, but I don't want to. I wish I was a better person, a stronger more driven person. I feel like a failure. I feel like a person with no direction and no purpose in this life. I feel like I can't do the things I want. I feel like I've wasted the life I was given and the chances I was given. I wish I would be different, but I don't seem to change. I'm weak, and yet I've done things that would equal strengths. When my dad died I got a second full time job and kept my household afloat. I was so behind in life. I got my license, but only now years later does it feel like things could move forward. They can't move forward though the path seems so far from me. I wish people didnt die. I wish that life was an endless journey. I wish I could have faith so death wouldnt feel so scary. I wish I was worth something.  


It feels like there are different parts of myself all fighting. One reminds me constantly that I'm going to die and I need to enjoy everything to the fullest. Another tells me I don't need to be here anymore, another that simple hates me and everything I am. Another that wants to live, dream, and have a wonderful life.

I'm 22 and have some life problems, its kind of depression or something that make me difficult to accept the reality of my life.

Until i'm 7 yo, i feel lonely and i seeking for answer for 'why i'm here and why my mother didn't here lived with me. i feel lost sometimes, i broke and crying inside my grandma wardrobe ( i hid inside ). then my days become dark without hopes. the only things that i want is ""Can i lived with my mother now!"", whats a mistake i did? why i'm here, why.

Shortly, when i'm 10 yo, finally i can lived with my mother and a stepfather, all is good, no problem, life like i want. I Know that my step father not often to interact with me like a normal father, he never educate me like other father did that to their child, i a boy anyway. But i thing its okay for step father to their step daughter.

But, i'm wrong. today i'm 22 and i feel how important for father to  educate their boy about life. the only who educate me about life is my mother, then i'm a boy raised by my mother, the result is a ""Mr Nice Guy"". if you ever read this book ""No More Mr Nice Guy  by Robert A Glover"" u will understand how that syndrome make me become depressed guy in 22. a man who seeking for approval that difficult to get that if u a Men. Because Men's problems need men's solutions too.

Believe or not i being a nice guys maybe start on 18 yo i feel. Its Make me stressed out until its getting hard to do an activity on my life, i broke, no hopes, everyone blames me, a small mistake will kill me. Its hard for me to said no, and i often to care taking to anybody instead for just helping, then every person that i just cared about will know that i cared about he/she will underestimating me.

Who can you blame other than yourself for your life to be going downhill? I'm already in my mid twenties and I just can't help but think that I'm behind. My childhood was great and my family did whatever they could to support me but unfortunately, I've taken that for granted. Highschool?

Lol, it sounds depressing/embarassing for me admit that but it's like I was predestined for failure. It's already been two years since I moved to Korea(I've stayed in Atlanta for 17 years) but the main reason why I moved back was because of the military service for the ROK and I thought it was an perfect opportunity to start something new. Unfortunately, that didn't start out well. I've got into it with my father(verbally) and its gotten to the point where he couldn't take it anymore. I never should had taken things for granted because he was the one that took me in when I had nowhere to go. I'm still having mixed feelings for him but one thing is that he is my father.   I'm worried about him because not only did he not come home for about a week but the texts that I've gotten from him was unbelievable.

Not only will I lose my own father but because it was my fault for him to plan something like that. I've been calling and calling but to no avail. He stated his phone is going to be off(which is still hasn't yet) and that I should be out of the house. I mean, since I'm staying under his roof, it's only right for me to get out since obviously, we can't get along unfortunately. I told him if it comes to it then I'll agree to go. I have nowhere to go and noone to depend on so I'm going to be homeless if it comes down to it. It's pathetic but I'm the one to blame. In retrospect, I've been nothing but a failure to my parents and I haven't been the best role model for my brother as well. To this day, I'm still blaming myself for the person that he had turned out to be. He could had gone far in football/basketball if I only was a better role model to him. It's like I've stated before, I was predestined for failure. It's only my father and I in this country while my mother and brother are still in the U.S. Nothing ever goes right for my family but if I lost my father because of this B.S then I honestly can't live/bare with myself so I'm just praying/hoping that he didn't do something that he will regret because of the caring people in his life..",What is the point of living if you know that your life has no meaning?,lifeisjustpassingby

depression,"I'm here, not just on this subreddit but reddit in general, because today was something of a wake call up call for me. I feel a need to connect to somebody who knows what they're talking about on the matter of mental health. I've been in a sort of dazed-denial like state for literally as long as I can remember. Up until I had a long period of reflection this morning I looked back on 'happiness' and 'stability' that lasted more than a day as some sort of childish thing I grew out of a while back. Ever since then its been endless spells of immobility. I can't commit to anything, *anything* without falling for the same traps of slipping up on deadlines, telling myself that none of it matters and that I'm my own man who makes my own way etc etc, and a conclusive adrenaline filled panic where I somewhat realize how I've screwed my life up and make up a bit of progress in a short bout of productivity. Two very uninterested shrinks who I've seen for a net time of like 5 hours helped me realize that my family situation is the root of all of my insecurities and fears. I scarfed down whatever pills they gave me and I didn't feel any different. I was upset when they mentioned depression and anxiety because I straight up never feel sad, not even on sad occasions, and I didn't think I had a problem with anxiety except when I had slacked in school and hurried to make things up before it was too late. They told me that the numbness and reclusive hold on my feelings was textbook depression, but I still didn't believe them. I despise talking about my problems, even to my most trusted friends and family, and I feel massive boost of confidence when I figure something out on my own. I now know through growing as a person and through having heart-to-hearts with peers that that kind of emotional independence doesn't come to everyone, and that a lot of people never recover from depression because they have no one to reach out to and end up consumed by themselves, and I was like ""Again with the D-word? I'm not sad, fuck off."" This sort of superiority complex over other people who're struggling like I am is something I've earnestly done my best to shed. On top of being a serious dick move, it doesn't help me. So overtime I gave up on therapy, told myself that it was all mushy shit that didn't help me in a scheme to sell me pills, and turned to a variety of thing that I either thought would **A.** Make me a better person or **B**. Make me feel good and forget about things for a while. Thus, for the last several years I've mostly bounced from being a hedonist sex addict, to a religious zealot, to a wannabe bodybuilder, and every other fringe community that can be categorized into either group A or group B. I've distanced myself from the family situation that was 100% bad for me, and I'm now in a stable environment, but I don't feel that much better. I've fucked my grades irreparably, pushed people away who were concerned for me, and I think the suicide scenes in movies look a little more cool and tempting than a new gun owner should think they do. After a long and undiluted reflection following another slip up at the end of a temporary inspired frenzy, I surmised that I probably don't know everything, and that the opinions I've long since discarded about my life probably hold some truth. So uh, what now, lol? I feel like this a ""good day"" and that's why I'm so chatty, but I also feel like the good days are fewer and more far between than ever. I'm not sure where to go next, in an objective, helpful sense, to be honest. **Forgive the wordy clusterfuck that this became. I'm just looking for some pointers on what to do from here.

depression,"First off, I don't have depression, I used to have depression/was feeling suicidal like several months ago, but now I'm better. I've been going through a lot lately and am going to go through a lot. 

Let me explain, currently I'm in high school (I'll be finishing high school in a year) so there's this exam that I'm going to write in 8 months, if I get good scores on it, I get admissions into top universities in my country, normally I wouldn't worry about exams and stuff but this time it's essential if I want to have a career in academics, and basically it really helps. I'm a pretty smart guy, at least I think so, like last year I got 98/100 in maths and 92/100 in the sciences and I'm kinda confident that I can do it.

The two things that are stopping me from being fully confident is that 1. that exam is SUPER HARD like famously hard, and 2. I'm procrastinating a lot, basically procrastinated through the whole 2020 and now I have to study 2 years(including this year) worth of stuff in 8 months and I'm still procrastinating.

I created a list of things I need to get in order. I emailed a gun store posing as someone looking for a self-defense weapon. I'm starting the budgeting process for a firearm. I have a calculated plan for the most part, which includes saying goodbye and attending confession to repent for my sins to try to save my soul if I can.

I started making wishes and gambling with the idea of ""if this happens"" I'll stay, but I don't want to stay when everything essentially leads back to this and when the true thing I want to happens seems nowhere insight. I would ideally liked to be talked out of this, but I am tired of hearing good people try to save me when I actively feel myself giving up every second. That's no fair and if I was a truly good person that's not something I should do. I don't want to be here anymore. I tried almost everything and there's things left, but I'm tired. Maybe I am supposed to feel this way as punishment for my sins. I'm not sure. I'm not sure of anything and if I'll make it to heaven. I hope so. The thought of going to hell terrorizes me, but the thought of spending more time feeling this way almost even more.

depression,"I'm 24/m and My dream is to be a voice actor. Always has been, i love animation and have always wanted to be a part of it. I even took theater all through high school and college. I took lessons and everything. I got encouraged by my idol, Megan Hollingshead, to pursue this dream after i sent her a fan letter. My sister,16, however, has never stated any interest in being an actress. She mostly wanted to be in sports. I cant play sports because of physical problems. So she had her thing, and i had my thing.

Recently, there was an open audition for a local tv show. I saw the ad and felt like it was fate, so i signed right up. I was really excited and couldn't help but talk about it, it's the most excitement i've felt in awhile. My sister didn't seem happy for me, she got annoyed cause it was all i talked about. But then she asked for the link to it so she could sign up too. I refused but she complained to our dad and he said he wouldn't drive me if i didn't.

Long story short, i didn't pass but i was ok with that, there were a ton of people trying out. I didn't get upset until she got called, they had a perfect role for her. She put it on speaker and asked me ""Isn't that great, i got picked!"" I stormed off and just started crying. I told her that it's not fair. She's living my dream. My dad said i need to support her but i told him no, that she shouldn't have been there and stole it from me. He said i should be proud, but i listed off everything i've done to get my foot in the door and it's unfair she can just waltz in and steal it. He told me life isn't fair. My sister keeps parading around and bragging to everyone and they both say i'm overreacting. I refuse to help her with her lines, i won't encourage her at all. I asked ""Don't you already have enough? You have sports, better grades and a beauty pageant trophy. Why do you have to take the 1 thing i want?""

She keeps throwing it in my face, asking me to help her with her lines but i won't.

I told her she doesn't deserve it. She cried but i didn't care.

Now, my sister vs me, she's perfect in every way. Pretty, athletic, successful academically and has sports scholarships. I can't play, i can barely walk across the room or stand for more then 10 minutes without pain, i'm also just not a looker. I have just one thing that makes me special, it's my main reason for getting up. Voice Acting. My one true passion, it's the one thing i dedicated my life too. I can't work normal jobs and my parents are forced to take care of me. I'd love to do it and seeing her get in on her first try with no effort really upsets me. I have to see her every day. It's the one thing that gets me out of bed in the morning.

But now, i feel just awful, very blue and just worthless. I have no talents. When my parents get sick of dealing with me, i'll have nowhere to go and will probably end up in a group home somewhere or assisted living, watching my sister live my dream out.

I posted in AITA and got all kinds of screwed up comments, how i should live with her being talented and everything and they made me want to cry.

I keep having internal arguments that I ALWAYS end up losing. Every single thing, it's MY fault and its ME who's a worthless good for nothing piece of garbage.  As a result of this, I also have an internal argument about whether this is just me being a depressed weirdo, or I truly am worthless, or if this mentality has just been programmed into me by my surroundings. I also have some sort of depression-related imposter syndrome. I keep telling myself that my depression is just a performance, and an excuse for being a lazy, weak, stimulation addicted loser. 

&amp;#x200B;

As of late, while my mental state is not improving, I am now starting to give myself the benefit of the doubt. I don't necessarily blame my issues on others, but rather I am trying to be realistic.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been meditating and I've come to realize that my family (mother and brother) has been kind of neglectful surrounding my depression. I opened up to them around a month ago. I told them absolutely everything. Suicidal thoughts, insomnia, self hatred, shower crying, how much my chronic tinnitus impacts me, everything man. Since then, no matter what happens or what they say, I just tell myself that I have a perfect support system around me and they mean well. That veneer I had for them in my head shattered today, when I mom straight up said ""you don't have depression"". I haven't been diagnosed, but that statement really hurt me, because there's the possibility that she's wrong, and in that case it leads to me blaming myself even more and avoiding getting the help I know I so desperately need. That moment made me reflect and look back at both my mother and my brother's demeanor over the past month, and I've come to realize that they haven't been that outlet that I'm looking for, not at all. I've become afraid to ask for advice and say anything to them because it always ends up shifting to ""you did this wrong"", ""you made me worried on this day"", ""you're ruining my mood lately"", etc. All we talk about is how shit I am doing in school, how I am being unproductive, etc. and NOT how I can get better, how I need to express myself more, whatever it may be. Actually, my mother has given me less attention since I've opened up, rather than more. Whenever I have a lunch with her and my brother I rarely get the chance to speak, offer my opinion, join the conversation, etc. And when I do speak I get cut off and they continue their conversation. It's like I have 0 respect in their eyes. I am now having this internal debate about whether or not I should feel disdain towards my family for this, or if this entire thing is just me being delusional, and once I'm out of my hole (if I ever escape it) I'll realize that my disdain was unfounded. At the same time, I feel like they've lost respect for me since I opened up, they've hurt me a lot with their demeanor towards me at times. Then Again, I could just be a pussy.

But right now I’m typing this at 1am because I can’t sleep while crying and seriously finding everything way too much and unable to focus on anything at all and can’t force myself to sleep.

I don’t even know what’s wrong with me, Ive been feeling “off” ever since I finished high school I guess which was like 4 years ago. and I feel like its just been getting worse in the background, I cry myself to sleep some nights, skip uni classes some days just cause I feel like it and wonder shopping centres. Buy stupid stuff I don’t need to give me some happiness.

I feel distanced from close friends and get overwhelmed quickly and act super quiet. I get agitated super easily and become extremely upset over minor inconveniences.

Ive been really struggling with focusing on tasks for quite a while now. I can’t even play video games which I enjoy or get myself to watch movies let alone doing uni work or sometimes even my actual work (which is from home, casual so I choose my hours which I‘m very bad at).

I write notes of stuff I need to do and end up writing the same thing down 5 times because I forgot I wrote it and still don’t end up doing it,

I‘m so bad at opening up about things so I just hide everything and get super upset sometimes but manage to calm myself and forget about it until next time something else happens.

Only person I’ve talked about it with is my girlfriend and I told her I’d get proper support a couple years ago and I eventually cracked and really tried to end of last year. I went to a GP at my uni and got referred to a therapist who was pretty good but we could only talk via zoom due to covid which I hated. I‘m very bad at social interactions at the best of times and online ones with people I don’t know tend to scare me more then in person. and at the end of the session (bit under an hour) she offered to meet with me again in a month. I was shocked because I thought it would be weekly but just went along with it and then ended up skipping that next session because I didn’t want to do another online one.

depression,"I don’t know why I’m writing this on Reddit for anyone to see when I literally haven’t talked about my life with anyone ever..  

Im a 22 yr old male and I’ve been unemployed for the last 2+ years. I have no idea what I want to do with my life or what career path I want to even start going down. I dropped out of community college when I was 19 bc i wasn’t smart enough and wasn’t getting good grades. I took the same math class 3 times, failing twice... I basically had no one pressuring me to go anymore so my Mom let me drop out bc i explained to her its pointless for me to go anymore. Waste of money 

Im the youngest of 3 kids, both my sisters are older and went to big colleges and now have full blown careers, even both of them are married now... They both had their life and future figured out by the time i just turned 18 and graduated high school. My sisters had full support from my parents and were always pressured to do good. So was I, but only in HS they were on my case... 
My parents soon got divorced after I graduated high school in 2016. They haven’t loved each other in years. I had to be at least 10-12 the last time they kissed and I saw it. 

So when I went into Community College it was like I had a blindfold on.. I had no idea why I was there or what i wanted to study, I guess I just wanted to make new friends. I tried but it didn’t happen as I planned.. I even got rejected a couple times by one or two girls too. 
So on top of all of that I’ve been lonely since I graduated high school like 4 almost 5 years ago now. I had a girl friend who was younger than I was when I was a senior, she was sweet but mean sometimes so obviously that didn’t work out so we broke up when I was 18 as well lol. 

Ive just been so depressed for so long now. All I do is stay inside and play video games. I am a terrible pot head so I constantly smoke my pain away. Every problem i ever had goes away when i take just one hit. Its sad. It furthers my depression bc it helps me forget about all my problems. And i do it whenever i can so i can just hide away and never confront my issues. Thats how my last 2 years of my life have felt like.

I live with just my Mother and she pays for all my bills and i love her n thank her for that. Im very thankful and help all around the house but my father hasn’t help me with anything in years. So I started to push my father away after the divorce and i dont answer his calls sometimes. He cares too much about himself and literally will just act like he cares about me still lol. Everytime i see him all we talk about is his life and his problems. Its like he forgot or just doesnt care that his son doesnt have a job and that im doing terrible in life. He doesnt care he is a scum bag, he takes half my mothers pay check every month bc of the divorce settlement. He doesnt even work himself anymore this is why they got divorced, over money. And then He will wonder why i dont talk to him and just acts like everything is perfectly fine and its just not. 

So as you can see my parents have been too worried about their own lives and their own futures that they have completely forgotten to help me with mine. They helped my sisters... They did everything a good parent should do for them but as soon as I graduated it was time for them to move on with their own lives and stop being parents... i just needed more motivation to  help me focus and pull me out of depression but i never got it so i let myself fall into pieces. 

Maybe if I could’ve just stopped my ex from leaving me, maybe i would still be in school rn or even done w it by now. She was the only person who pressured me n actually made me feel like i had a purpose, or im just mistaken and I was just really happy when i was with her bc she was my first and only girlfriend.. i just need someone to love me again idek anymore😥

We had a lot of fun together, really understood each other, and it seemed like I met the perfect person, but as they say ""all good things must come to an end."" As always, she broke up with me because of unresolved trauma that she was dealing with. I've never been good with break ups, and this one has been unbearable just considering the circumstances and the state of the world currently already. Not to mention, I'm always the one who's gotten dumped when romantically involved with someone. Life has just seemed more and more pointless since then, and all of life's flaws are starting to reveal themselves more than ever.

I feel like I've already used up all my energy, or life has taken the rest of it.

depression,"Hello all, I apologize for the lengthy post, but I am seriously in need of some guidance here as I want to help her in any way I can. 

TL;DR - My sister struggles to find motivation, especially relating to school, and I am just looking for ways to help her as best as I can. 

I (19M) connect really well with my younger half-sister (14). We play video games, watch YouTube videos and shows together, gossip, and have a lot of the same interests. When it comes to this, our sibling connection is nothing short of awesome. However, outside of this, her motivation to do anything is almost nonexistent. 

When it comes to school, she is rather smart for a freshman. It is when she has to apply her knowledge and skills that her desire to do so is lackluster. Getting up for school every single morning is a mission. She has to be up at 6 AM to start getting ready and be finished by 7 for her friend to pick her up. She is ""unable"" to get out of bed on her own without someone physically waking her up. I try my best to help her by nudging her, talking to her, just doing anything I can to wake her up slightly. Sometimes, its enough. It may take a whole 45 minutes, but its possible. On other days (like today), she doesn't budge. She insists that school is pointless and a waste of time and that she's going to fail anyway (she has probably missed 50% of the school year so her grades have reflected this). When I get her out the door, its smooth sailing. She goes to school, no problems. She comes home, takes a nap, plays on her Switch. I have work and night classes so we talk when I get home for a short while and everything seems fine. I ask her how school went and she always says it was horrible and nothing more. And then the next day, we try it all over again. 

I just don't understand why she feels this way. On the *surface*, all seems well. She has friends, she participates in JROTC which is of interest to her, and she goes to a really nice school. She has never mentioned anything of bullying or harassment. Currently, it feels like our parents are going through a midlife crisis, as our biological mother is never home these days with the exception of checking in on us every 4 days or so. They have long since given up on their daughter and her school life, as her father is rather mentally abusive and our mother has become somewhat delusional over the past 3 years. So that just leaves me to somewhat act as a parental figure. I was raised in my high school days by my father, who was active military for 20 years. In his house, there was structure and responsibilities that needed to be done. Chores, school, with the occasional work on weekends. She simply has to go to school and nothing more, so obviously its a little difficult for me to empathize with her as I had it way harder. Nevertheless, I still want to make it easier for her.

Based on what I've said so far, has anybody else had an experience like this and could maybe give some potential solutions to help my sister? I'm 19 and ready to move out to a bigger city, but I fear what may become of her if I leave her behind to cope with her current situation.",My Sister Struggles to Find Motivation in Anything,zestlyboi

depression,"My SO was yesterday put on Lexapro by an older psychiatrist, when she asked him for the side effects he basically ignored her questioned. 

I'm quite worried, but she made her decision. And it's her own path to recovery.

However, i'm also plagued by a lot of negative intrusive, suicidal and  thoughts at times. And i'm sure many of you on this board have them as well.

The question however i want to ask is:

Why do i see people here claiming that meds helped them get their life back when all it does is just mask the issues? Isn't it fair to say that this modern capitalist world is driving us absolutely batshit insane?

Many of us (especially my generation) are knee deep in debt, poor, can't get jobs, and there is a rising of property costs and costs of living in general. We work too many hours, get paid very little, and we expect NOT to be depressed, and we are directed to ''psychiatrists'' who gladly prescribe us with pills as if its fucking candy. Why do we accept this to happen? Why do we mask our pain with pills? Hell i'd rather have weed be legalized where i live, that's a way better anti-depressant than any pill (legal, or illegal) that i'm aware of. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now, i totally understand that depression, psychosis etc can be more than just a disease brought on by our immediate environment, and that it CAN be a defect within the brain.

I totally also understand that meds are supposed to be taken along with cognitive behavioral therapy,but i've heard already from many people that their psychiatrist prescribed them this and that pill without even second guessing themselves...what gives? 

I want also to ask you redditors here...if your life was better, if you were financially independent, happy, fulfilled, with your own land, your own house, a great loving S.O., achieving your own dreams and goals, and not being forced to work in a horrible system, in a world where billionaires start wars and step on the throats of the poor. If you didn't know the injustices going on, the horrible truth to this fucking society that plagues us. Would you still be depressed? 

&amp;#x200B;

However, that is NOT the case. We DO live in such a world and such a horrible society...i feel that if i went to a therapist, my thoughts alone that i have presented here would classify me as ''paranoid'' and ''manic depressive''. Which is fucking ridiculous.

&amp;#x200B;

Fuck this fucking system. It's the reason we are all so desperately depressed and need pills to stone our minds from seeing the truth.

- i always do the wrong thing. If i worry, i worry to much, if i dont worry im being reckless

- any time i even begin to be stupid enough to have hope, my life ends up way worse (this is one of the main ones)

- for the past 2 years ive tried gratitude meditation, and i learn to accept the new low, only to have it sink lower and lower. All
I had left was being physically alive but that's not worth it any more

- I've never fit in, not really. Always felt like a weirdo. 

- i don't function like an adult. Im a child in a 35 year olds body. I cant cope with what adult life is meant to be, its time for my life to be over

- im not good at anything, not really. Everything has ro be pointed out to me wbd even then i just don't get it

- im just so wortheless thst basiclly 24/7 im treading water to prepare, plan, etc.

But the main one is the fact that my life is a farce. It just keeps getting worse and worse and signs of Hope are actually danger signs that things will get worse

So im ending it.

My plan:
- ive saved enough money to cover my rent for the rest of our tenancy, so my partner won't be burdened. 
- my neighbours have the keys to my house and I've told them im not feeling well and am taking myself to the hospital and theyve agreee to feed my cats until my psrtner gets back 
- I've planned my funeral written all the details and set aside money.

depression,"(24 M) I'd like to start off by saying that I've had very bad social anxiety ever since about middle high school and I’ve never posted anything like this on Reddit or any other forum. I’ve gotten over this disorder but I still relapse from time to time during periods of stress. I've never had that many friends in my life and I struggle to make new friends because of my awkward and introverted personality. The small group of friends that I do have are awesome and we've been friends for at least 10 years. We all share common interests and regularly go out and do things together like working on cars and fishing. I have been dating my girlfriend for a few years but she is has the exact opposite personality to me – she is very approachable, extroverted, has many friends. I love her very much but she doesn’t really understand how I feel despite having conversations about it with her.

I was never a very average student in high school, but that all changed when I started doing what I was really passionate about in university (computer science). Despite having very little engagement during classes, I was able to graduate university with a 3.8 GPA. I took an opportunity to start my career right after my first year of university where I worked as a contractor for various companies while being a full-time student.  

Since graduating last year I have secured a full time position that pays me enough that money is never an issue for me. Since the pandemic hit I’ve been working from home the whole time, not putting anywhere near the effort as I was doing when doing contract work. I’ve gained weight, I’ve gotten really lazy and I’m not putting anywhere near the same amount of effort as I did when I was doing contract work. I don’t have any real friends at this workplace and all my online meetings feel very transactional and I have struggled to develop any sort of meaningful relationships at work. This has led me to feel really lonely and depressed. I spend most of my work days now just playing games and watching Netflix while doing just enough to make my manager and my workplace happy.

I feel as though I have achieved everything that I have ever wanted to do – I am currently paying off my house by myself, I own a boat, have a nice car and a nice career. However, I feel directionless and detached from my friends. I don’t feel like I fit in with my friends as much as I used to and I struggle to make new friends due to my awkward personality. I have no goals or aspirations in life anymore, and feel zero happiness day in, day out. Now I want to be very clear that I have zero intentions, or any remote feelings of suicide, but at the same time I feel as though my life is meaningless.

Once I reach that feeling of I know how the job operates and know what to expect in my daily routine it turns either boring, stressful, mind numbing work, or all three.

depression,"I think we have all been told multiple times that it feels good to complete a task. That there will be relief, that the stress will go away. I have yet to feel that way. Having goals and completing them has never made me feel good about myself. On the contrary, completing tasks makes me feel depressed and stressed out. If I have a reward goal, the work to get the reward just devalues the reward for me.

Ive been medicated &amp; in therapy, with a 2 serious suicide attempts to my name. At the moment I'm just seeing a therapist who is excellent. 

I've suddenly started to realise how lonely I have been from a young age, and realising the roots of my feelings of worthlessness and being completely unloveable (and undesirable). The sadness of this, along with sadness at who I potentially could have been, and how I have no idea how to feel love or loved, feels unbearable. It feels completely different to what I'm used to, and its frightening at times. I feel like I'm coming to terms with the scope of the impact of low self worth &amp; depression has had on my life. The impact of disassociation from my own self, my body, my feelings. I suddenly realise that I don't know who I am or what I believe in or stand for.

depression,"There is another thread with someone who is having an issue losing attraction to his gf. The lockdown has triggered her depression and she's gotten pretty bad. No motivation to do anything. Gained 50 lbs in a few months.

Some people suggested that he give her extra compliments. Spoil her with love and affection. Make her feel needed and desired. Recreate that honeymoon phase. All to help remind her what she means to him and help her restore a positive self-image which would hopefully help motivate her to start taking better care of herself. 

There is an argument that this would be dishonest. That it's better to find other ways to compliment her. They suggest that it's better not to lie and pretend to want her like that until he genuinely feels it. He should tell her she's compassionate or sweet or smart. Whatever other compliments still ring true to the bf. Also with the hope that this way will restore her internal confidence and help motivate her.

Some think that avoiding compliments of her appearance will send a subtle message that she'll pick up on and she'll feel worse. Others say that it's wrong and dishonest to tell her she's beautiful if he doesn't truly feel it in the moment. That it's not authentic. 

I won't say which side I agree with but I will say I was very surprised at how much support the opposing perspective gained. In an interest to give the right kind of support to the people I care about I felt like I had to look into this.

I came out of it really slowly, but eventually it seemed that things were looking up. More recently, however, I’ve found myself panicking whenever I feel myself getting depressed because I’m paranoid I’ll have another episode. I don’t want to go back there, and I’m terrified of it happening again. 

I know it’s irrational, but it’s been making it really hard for me to enjoy life with this constant worry that it’ll be snatched away from me. Has anyone else ever experienced this, and do you have any advice? Thank you :)",Dealing with some paranoia after my last depressive episode,Scorpwhal

I want things to be like they were and to stay that way. I'm so tired of worrying and I can't clear my head. Every time I think to approach the problem I remember all the obstacles in the way, and I give up before I even start.

The walls are closing in, and I'm running out of time. I don't know what to do and it's chipping away at me as each day draws closer. I have this pent-up anxiety around the things I want to say, that I can't even bring out since I've spent so much time being closed to others that it almost feels like I want to say it but can't.

depression,"I'm not sure what to say but I felt compelled to reachout and maube just vent.  I've always been low and have battled with mild depression most of my life. I'm a 39 year old male.

This last couple of weeks have been especially difficult.  My mom passed away a couple weeks ago.  I've never had a healthy relationship with her as I suspect she suffered from Bipolar and Narcissistic Personality Disorder. My childhood wasn't exactly healthy.

Also, my girlfriend dumped my a couple days ago and I believe that really triggered even further thoughts of worthlessness, sadness, and grief.  It wasn't a very long relationship but losing the hope and excitement and closeness that comes with a new relationship has really affected me.   

My self esteem is at an all time low, I'm alone, and I'm scared.   I cry easily, can't sleep, or eat.  I honestly don't know what to do.  I know things will get better, if even a little bit, but I'm afraid that I don't have the strength to make it. I'm afraid that things won't ever work out and, as silly as it sounds, happiness is meant for other people.

I've been seeing a therapist for the last couple months a few times a month but have increased my sessions to 2x a week and have another session on Thursday.  I try to lean on a friends and share my feelings with those around me.  I am not afraid to be open and vulnerable or cry when I need to.  

I don't think I would ever end my life but I do have moments where I'm not afraid to do it which scares me. I have a loose plan in my end. I have called the suicide prevention hotline a couple times the last couple days which I find helpful.  My brother committed suicide when I was younger and seeing the damage that that caused my family is one of the reasons why I don't entertain the idea too much.

I have final test tomorrow in a course that is also a necessary course for the courses in my next year of the university program I am attending. Which means that if I don’t pass this course I wouldn’t be able to study 3 courses next year and I would essentially have to take a year off my school. So this course is pretty important and unfortunately very hard (dynamics and statics). 

I haven’t really studied a lot and it’s is filling me with anxiety and I am even having heart palpitations. I already am south behind in school and I don’t want another course in my backpack. There is a reexam in the second week of June, but I have like 2 other exams that week too.

Fat, lazy, unmotivated, undriven, doesn’t take that extra little step, continues to make the same fucking mistakes every single exam period. I have high ambitions but I feel like a fucking loser. I have so fucking high dreams and potential that I believe I can achieve but I don’t do shit to chase it. Such a fucking bum. 

I wasn’t like this though. In high school I was so fucking driven, so motivated, extra curriculars, best grades, favorite student, got scholarships and everything but everything feels so fucking hopeless now and I am so fucking unhappy with my life and I wanna change this shit.

Reasons I don’t have value:
1 I am stupid 
I didn’t see a car coming recently and turned in front of it and didn’t realize until they slammed on their horn I am lucky they didn’t hit me.

Not sure if this is the case everywhere but where I live theirs almost always a crosswalk in school zones where once the lights turn red they begin to flash. While they are flashing cars must yield to pedestrians but if theirs are none they treat is a stop sign. Well this morning I get to the crosswalk and the lights begin flashing but I’m not quite a the crosswalk line but I’m past the stop line for cars so I start to walk across before the lights shut off and the cars start going and almost hit me then the ones behind them stop and let me cross i have no idea if I was in the wrong but I am sure I was and wish they hit me. 

Reason number 2: I have made bad life choices my whole life

I am 21 and have no life. I got horrible grades in high school literally only barely passing because I was depressed all throughout. I have no motivation in a dead end job and a girlfriend who is beyond my league and am constantly afraid she is only with me out of pity.

Reason number 3 I am a dirtbag
I try my best to be a good person and help people but all I seem to do is bring others down. I used to be known and the amazing Christian boy who always helps others. Now I’m just a shadow of my former self. I try but I can’t seem to help someone without making it worse.

depression,"Semi rant/Semi word spew.

I have suffered with pretty bad anxiety and depression my whole life. Every year since I was 13 has been a real struggle. I cant actually pinpoint any time from 2010 to now and actually describe sustained feelings of happiness. I feel behind on most things in life. I dont have a career, hardly in friends and I still live with my parents. I have taken medication and attended therapy for years and its really not worked.These past 2 years have been very hard since i graduated from university. I struggled to find work and now Im in a job i dislike while others who have 'wronged me' in the past settle into their careers and long term relationships (karma doesnt exist). The way my life has turned out, has bewildered me. I feel like everything is outside my control and Im just waiting to be hit by more shitty news. I cant even start to think positively anymore. I try to even read a nice book and I cant do it anymore due to my anxiety and depression. I basically just work and sleep.

 I am honestly so depressed most of the time I dont even know how I made it this far. At the moment I live in constant physical pain from the depression. It feels like i have a block artery in my heart. Not a panic attack feeling but like my heart has sustained damage from such long-lasting stress. I want to die because i feel like nothing will really change and everyone patronises me, especially medical professionals.. I have tried so many medications and all I get is adverse side affects but medication is the only solution people can offer me long term.

I feel a constant burden to my parents. Im 24 for fucks sake. I should have something sorted out, but I dont. I still have to talk about my problems to my parents or I would just go crazy and start talking to a wall and I hate that. I hate stressing them out. However, even when I do talk to them, It doesnt work, they cant help and often just cant see the big picture anymore. They cant understand the complexities of where I am coming from anymore. They think im depressed because I dont have X in my life, or because of some recent bad event, but its not that all. Everything has just built up and up over the years I dont know where to even begin. All I know is that Im depressed- because Ive been depressed for so long with all these negative experiences just  keep building and building on top of one another. 

I am due to see a psychiatrist soon (I saw one in approx 2014, when I was 17), its really my last chance and finding something that will work for me. I should of probably seen one sooner but I realistically couldnt afford it and my GP just kept saying to attend my psychologist. I feel cheated by this depression, like my youth has been stolen from me. 

I think another thing I really struggle with is trying to control my anger and rage at the past and the situation Im in because of, well, young men. I was seriously physically bullied by young men from the ages of 13-17. 

 I feel like they are behind a lot of where my pain stems from. I wasnt raped or sexually assaulted, but I honestly fear men, and my self-esteem is so low sometimes I feel what i have experienced was as bad as that. When I see a young man I just automatically think that he must think Im ugly and weird and 100 other nasty things, because of what was done to me in high school. Im really really upset Im still a virgin at 24 . Not for the fact that Im a virgin, but for the fact that I dont trust men because of my past experiences which has resulted in me never being intimate or even close with a male friend, colleague or lover. Im not upset at being a virgin, Im upset because of what has led me to this point and it feels like it was out of my control. I have no male friends and I have never really interacted with men. Of course, there are many negative things that have caused my depression to become totally worse and manifest into something completely out of control, but I think if Im realistic this is where it all started.

I want to point out, before someone nasty comments state that my problem is that Im an 'incel'. I am not a female incel. I love men in the respect I logically think they have a lot to offer women, and Im still very much attracted to them. I can talk to men easily in casual conversation, but Ive never been able to develop a bond with them in any capacity. I think that there are good men out there, but when I am in their company I feel completely worthless and not worthwhile of their company subconsciously, and I cant help it. Ive have tried to use dating apps and I get matches, but I just cant bring myself to meet a male stranger, or pursue anyone. It almost feels like PTSD, to me. My only experience is when I've been drunk and Ive never really enjoyed myself being around men when Im like this. 

What hurts too is that Ive kind of given up on all interpersonal relationships and it scares me. It scares me I cant trust others- not just in dating but in all relationships. As I mentioned earlier, I dont even have many close female friends. I really really want friends, and maybe even a partner, but no one seems to care or can connect with me. Ive never moved past my problems (clearly) and I dont know how to. I just dont want to be a negative Nancy around anyone and half the time I feel like I push people away by talking about too much negative shit. Ive been tested for ASD, personality disorders and they all came back negative. Sometimes I wish I had an excuse. Even therapists have been kind of oblivious about how to handle my situation as they have all stated my past negative experiences with men are because these 'men' actually liked me, which trust me, wasnt the case. They kind of just expect me to build a bridge move on, but I cant for some reason. Every girl at my age has seemed to have some positive experience with boys/young men but I havent, and it gets to me (as in the fact Ive never even had a male friend, for example). 

Im just gonna wrap it up here and say, at the end of the day, part of me doesn't even care anymore If I stay as a spinster at this point, as Id rather be depression free with some inner peace, than live with a partner just for the sake of feeling slightly better. But I really just wish I had some good people in my life you know? Someone to restore my faith and trust. At the moment its just too much to bare. I find it hard to relate to others, Im bitter and damaged. lol i feel jealous and people who have experienced depression for only short periods, how fucked up is that? 

I am so angry and depressed these past couple months of where I am at 24 in my life, it affecting my family and destroying them. The pain and guilt is driving me to suicide.

depression,"I think I was depressed from the end of 2019 til the end of 2020. And while 2020 was not the worst year of my life, it’s been the worst my mental health has ever been, and no, Covid was not the issue.

For context, I’ll explain my life leading up to this episode. I’ll keep it brief, though. A few years back I endured a lot of pain all at once. Mother developed cancer, dad cheated while mom had cancer. Father became toxic to be around and berated my mom. I was also in a controlling and emotionally abusive relationship at the same time. Parents divorced. Repercussions, etc. It was probably the most pain I’d ever felt in my life, and I remember desperately wanting to escape my suffering - fantasizing an out, but I somehow got through it and found happiness as soon as the events resolved themselves. Thing is, a lot of the pain from those events was tearing at me subconsciously and I didn’t know it yet. 

Fast forward, a few years, and bam, I’m a senior soon to graduate high school. I was immensely stressed, trying to navigate scholarships, college apps, etc. I was also really lonely because I was dually enrolled in a community college trying to boost my gpa and class rank. 

The thing is, I was finding it harder and harder to enjoy the moment as the days went by. Everything just kept disappointing me, from fun outings, to movies, to simple conversations with others. I assumed it was because of stress.
I had also assumed that when second semester hit, and I started reaping the benefits of my hard work, id feel happier and more fulfilled. But when the awards and honors and recognitions came, I felt nothing. I got accepted into every college Id applied to and felt nothing. When I got accepted into my dream school, I didn’t feel happy at all. While everyone was celebrating acceptance letters, I just felt a faint sense of relief knowing I hadn’t been rejected. But I wasn’t happy. 
When I got named salutatorian of my graduating class - an achievement I had been striving for for over four years, I felt....inadequate. And the insecurity and constant comparisons started to get to me. 

I would lash out at my family more often than not. I would spend days at a time just scrolling through social media without talking to anyone. Friends would call or text and I’d just never reply. The idea of being out in public just made me feel even more insecure. 
I was paranoid that when people spoke to me, they could see that my smile did not match my eyes. That they could see how empty I was. Nothing satisfied me. My hobbies stressed me out. Nothing felt fulfilling because nothing I ever did was good enough. And I became frustrated because I knew it would never be enough. I was truly starting to hate myself and who I’d become as I started gaining weight and neglecting chores, and when covid hit, I neglected my hygiene.
I became unhealthily obsessed with how the world saw me. But I could never find a sense of quiet or peace within myself, even as I sat alone in my room. 
I began to question the whole point of why I’d worked so hard in high school when I realized I could not afford my dream school. And from there, I spiraled and I began to question the meaning of life. I began to see life as a chore. And then I developed a level of anxiety I’d never felt before. 
My hands were always shaking, and my heart was always racing and my thoughts were always on repeat. And there was never a break from any of it. From the moment I’d wake up til the moment I’d fall asleep, it was just this constant and overwhelming stress that weighed so heavily on me. This was also the time in which I became more aware of the fact that I was ruminating excessively. No matter what it was that I was doing, I was constantly replaying the events of the past (the divorce, the relationship) over and over and over and over. Analyzing. Replaying. Dissecting. And even though, those things weren’t even active triggers for my stress, my mind kept replaying them over and over and over and over because it was a pain I knew the end of. And the pain I currently felt had no foreseeable end. (I would also obsess over my college decision as well)

At its worst, I found basic tasks to be - disproportionately overwhelming? Illogically Anxiety inducing? Something as simple as doing laundry would spike my stress levels. And I knew it was a simple task, but doing it, would just stress me greatly. 
I began to fear what college would mean for me in the fall, as I found myself struggling to function. I tried describing what I was feeling to my mom, and while she always listened, I don’t think she knew how trapped I felt in my own mind. It’s like I couldn’t focus long enough to even experience a moment.

Then one day, the intense physical effects of anxiety just disappeared, and I felt relief. Genuine relief. I was able to get stuff done without feeling overwhelmed.
And then, the apathy kicked in. I have never been so unmotivated in my entire life. I’d experienced periods of not wanting to do anything for months at a time, but during those difficult periods, I was always able to remind myself of my “why”.  This, though, was something totally different. I simply just did not care as I began to fail multiple classes during my first semester. My hair was falling out and it didn’t matter to me at all. 
A lot of stuff was going wrong, and I couldn’t bring myself to feel the gravity of the situation. I just did not care one bit because life felt like a path to nowhere. I never wanted to die, but I began to believe that my life would always be numb and empty. I actually forgot what happiness felt like. The only thing that made me believe there was hope was the fact that I’d experienced the pain I had experienced a couple years ago and had made it out on the other side. 
I was able to laugh and get out of bed and do things but it didn’t have meaning to me. And I was scared because I knew I should care but I didn’t. 

I’m not sure what happened at the end of 2020, but towards the arrival of New Year’s Eve, I started finding myself laughing at things more. Genuine actual laughter. And I found myself suddenly able to appreciate the profoundness of one of my favorite films. And I found myself genuinely enjoying the music playing in the car. And I still have zero clue as to why I suddenly started finding the ability to appreciate the things around me. And my mood continued to elevate dramatically. For three days straight, I felt so overwhelmed with an intense happiness I hadn’t felt in years, I can’t even explain it. Everything just felt so ridiculously beautiful. 
After a while, the random burst of joy sorta faded and I was left with just the ability to appreciate the gravity/ beauty of things before me. I found myself still a little unmotivated, but I was able to push myself to start building back what I had let slide first semester and start reminding myself of my “why”.
As of right now, I’m still struggling, but I have more happy days than sad. It’s just that, I didn’t realize I had forgotten what joy even felt like. You know? I’d just become so numb to it. And now, emotions are more vivid if that makes sense...

I also want to make it clear that I’m not saying all of this to say to anyone going through severe stress or anxiety or depression or any mental health struggle that time will fix it or that it will just get better on it’s own. Nor am I trying to discount the fact that it’s a daily uphill battle for many people. I know everyone is different and has experienced their own unique set of pain, and I don’t ever wish to impose/  offend anyone by me posting this.

I truly don’t even know if I was depressed because I was never able to see a therapist. But I’m just looking back on recent events and starting to realize that maybe I was...and I just wanted to tell my story/ put my thoughts out since I’ve never felt comfortable telling anyone in my personal life. 


I do eventually plan to talk about this with a professional when I can afford it, but as the days go on, I can’t seem to remember much of what I felt.

depression,"**Hi.**

*I'm really sorry for this terrible formatting, but I have never written a post before so this is all new to me.*

So. I don't really know how to begin writing this so I'll just get straight to the point since I have no experience in the writing department of posts and stuff.  I'm 17 year old gal and idk what to do.

I have been for quite a while in a really dark place. I haven't been diagnosed and I don't think it's necessary because I feel like I'm just looking for attention. I am not sure though if I actually should seek medical help or no.

I have selfharmed in the past but I am clean for a while now, constantly thinking about comitting suicide, lethargy, terrible procrastination. My hygiene is poor because I constantly lack the motivation and energy to do basically anything. I'm probably addicted to playing games idk. I'm always tired no matter what I eat or how much I sleep. I have probably suffered from an eating disorder because I was dieting horribly watching my weight plummet on a scale in matter of weeks to being underweight. I loathe everything about me, but would go out of even in an uhealthy way to do something for someone or to please them. I have very little friends and I am aware that they and my family probably love me but I feel like they're obligated to do so and in reality noone cares. My grades aren't the best but aren't the worst either. Always feeling numb and alone. Always wanting to cry but no tears come. I have problems with keeping my attention at the places where it matters and I have to thus giving me endless trouble.

Then there are the moments when I do feel happiness like on family gatherings or with friends. Those moments make me doubt myself even more if I am just being a dramatic ass or if there might be genuinely something wrong with me. I can laugh, I can watch funny videos. It seems as I live a normal healthy life, roof over my head, awesome parent...

Yet I feel this way and it pisses me off because it makes me feel guilty that I'm ungrateful for everything that I have since it can always be worse and there are people who have it much worse than me. It just feels like I'm not enough and that I am ungrateful for even the little that I do have. I am probably privileged in so many ways that it feels like I have no right to be like this. I did try to confront my parent about how I feel but they just said it will go away. It hasn't, I felt like this for years now. and I also feel like I don't want to bother them because they've had it much worse.

I don't really know what else to write on here because my mind is constantly racing with everything that's going or not going or what could be going on. So I'll end this ranting post here. Sorry for it being such a long essay xD.

I was with my tutor and I was trying to understand math because I’ve basically didn’t learn anything in online classes because I just spent playing games. But now covid has died down in my country, we’re going back to school and midterm are coming and I haven’t caught up with what they were teaching and now I have to copy notebooks from classmates and try to understand new content as well.

So I asked my tutor should I just quit school next week because midterm tests are coming and I don’t know anything. She said you can’t run from it forever and she’ll try to help me as much as possible that’s when I think I started crying. Idk why, maybe it was worry, maybe it was the consequences of bad grades (like colleges review your past performance and determine whether scholarship or not). I tried to calm down and finished my lesson with my tutor. 

When she walked out of home, I lay on the carpet and started sobbing then move to my bedroom. I called my therapist and told her about it, she recommended me some music to hear and say words like “I’m sorry, please forgive me, I love you, I thank you” and I tried saying them while tears are dropping.

depression,"I stressed to the max and feel like I’m about to break. I have a public facing tech support job that has gotten more and more stressful as the years have gone on but I can’t afford to quit it. And also for the past year my father has started showing signs of dementia. 

I shouldn’t hate my job but I do. I’m a college dropout that’s making $50K a year and I have amazing benefits. But the constant monitoring and micromanaging is getting to me. And the angry and rude customers is really bringing me down. It’s very common for customer to start off a call by saying “I’m having terrible day because I have to talk to you”. I know that they know nothing about me personally but it gets to you after hearing comments like that for 40 hours a week. 

My other issue with the job is that it’s changed from being a tech focus to sales. I’m expected to convince all those angry customers to increase the plan for their cell phone bill while fixing their issues. Im great at fixing problems but terrible at convincing people to spend more money every month when they’re already unhappy with the amount that they’re spending. I’m on the edge of getting fired. Doing this job from home isn’t for me but my company says we’re doing it permanently. My performance is trash, I log out at unscheduled times because I’m so stressed, I’ve used up 90% of my paid time off and it’s only March. I want to quit but I’m in debt up to my eyeballs and will take a massive pay cut anywhere I go because cell carrier tech support experience doesn’t translate to other jobs. 

On top of my work issues my father is showing signs of dementia. He had a stroke 2 years ago and last year his memory and decision making abilities have taken a significant drop. I had to move out of my parent house last year because he was making too much noise while I was working; banging on doors and screaming at my mom. 

Now that I’m out on my own I call my mom almost every day because she wants advice on what to do with my father. But she leaves out important details and never follows through on what she says that she going to do. My father doesn’t need to be driving because his memory is atrocious but we can’t convince him to talk to the doctor about it and I’m. It sure if it’s matter. It’s weird, he’s completely out most of the time but as soon as he’s around any medical professionals or angry about any perceived wrongs his communication skills  and thinking ability jump to 120%. My parents car died and my father wanted me to drive him to a dealership and test drive a car which I refused. He got out of the hospital 2 weeks ago and agreed not to drive but has reneged. He remembers the promise but isn’t honoring it. And just like always since I wasn’t giving him his way he started insulting me just like the customers at my job. If it wasn’t for my mother I wouldn’t have any dealing s with him at all.

Yesterday,i was walking on  pedestrian bridge to my university to attend an exam, i stood there for a moment and thought of jumping off the bridge and imagined what could happen to me, then i continued my walking.

This is one of my nearest moment to suicide

I didn't tell anyone about that, i act like everything is normal &amp; that nothing happened.

I feel that i am hyocrite or separated into parts, i really can't describe  what i feel.

depression,"Trigger warning - suicidal thoughts. 

Thanks to all who read this. Wish each and every one of you all the best. I’m posting here because I don’t know what else to do. I’ve suffered with anxiety and depression for years now and it’s just cost me the best connection I’ve ever had with another person. I dated my girlfriend for over a year and my constant irritability and overall failings have now cost me the relationship. I’ve also been dealing with suicidal thoughts lately, and now I get a rush of thoughts centred along the lines not wanting to go on whenever it dawns on me that she’s not going to be coming over anymore or want to see me.  

I know relationships aren’t the be all and end all and I’m grateful for the good times we had, as well as the good things in my life, I really am. But I’m also so fucking sad. It’s hard to find a reason to keep going when you feel like you’ve honestly lost your soulmate. And I don’t say that melodramatically, I felt something cosmic when I met her and still do. I realistically thought I’d marry her. And I’ve fucked it all up by not being able to let stupid bullshit go. And being annoyed when I shouldn’t be. I fucking despise myself for this... I finally found who I was waiting for for years and I couldn’t just grow the fuck up. 

I’m not asking for anyone to offer me a magic solution, I just wanted to be heard because I’m in my dark room crying my eyes out and the pain is so much. I will miss her terribly every single day.

depression,"Okay so basically I'm writing this message on a voice note cuz I can't be bothered to type it out but in my life right now I just feel like I don't really care about anything. I could die any moment and I wouldn't really be that bothered. It's like I'm just kind of existing. I have an excellent diet I exercise regularly. I'm really into the gym and I have hobbies and I have friends and recently I've been going on dates and I know it's lockdown but it's been socially distanced so yeah don't mention that I'm irresponsible in that sense because I'm not. But I can't help shake this feeling of simply not caring. I've been on antidepressants for over 2 years now trying different ones. I've tried Lexapro I've tried sertraline I've tried mirtazapine I've also tried venlafaxine, wellbutrin, as well as lots of all the nootropics literally as many as I can think of. Nothing has truly shaken this feeling of not caring. Some of the antidepressants have given me more of a drive but mainly sexually and what was worse as I felt more anxious on these drugs So I've gone back to taking the one that agrees with me the most which is lexapro and I take that at a dose of 10 mg a day and have done this for a year now. I've also tried testosterone replacement therapy and while this was useful for putting on muscle in the gym which I found was starting to diminish with age (I'm now 26 by the way, male) It didn't fix the mental lack of interest in life. I'm at the stage where I feel like I just have to be comfortable with who I am and not try and change it. I think I just wanted to run my thoughts and see if anyone has to say about this.

depression,"Hello everyone. I hope you're as well as you can be. I'm not sure who will read this, but I haven't been able to tell anyone else in my life, so I figured I'd turn to the anonymity of the internet. If you make it through this whole thing, thank you. It feels kinda nice to write it all out.

On Saturday, after months of anguish and hard decisions, I decided to surrender my two dogs to the local humane society. I don't know anyone locally, and I'm a bad judge of character, so I figured the humane society would have better judgement and policies to make sure they find a proper home.

I surrendered them because I know that I cannot give them what they need. I have suffered from depression, anxiety, etc. for over a decade. I got these dogs to try and address these problems. Unfortunately, they alone are not enough to lift me out of myself. They got me outside to go to the bathroom, sure. But other than that? I still stayed inside most of the time. I still didn't take care of myself. And by extension, I didn't give them what they needed: more frequent baths, teeth brushing, frequent brushing, and more importantly, the love they deserve. They needed someone who could love them and play with them instead of breaking down and dissociating all the time. I did and do still love them. But it's evident that I was not the best friend they could have. I thought I could help these dogs when I adopted them: one had medical issues with his foot and hips, and the other only had one eye. And by helping them, maybe I could help myself. But I failed myself, and more importantly, failed them.

I didn't share this with anyone in my life because I knew everyone would tell me that I was wrong. They would and have told me that I am in fact a good owner. That I do care for them adequately. That they don't need for anything. But I did not want doubt to stop me from doing the right thing; getting them a better life with a better person. And I know I would have hung on if I had voices telling me lies to make ME feel better. At the expense of these beautiful dogs.

As sad and depressed as I am, I have never been a crier. I've had friends and family die, and while I am deeply sad, I have never cried for them. But when I said my goodbyes to my dogs, I couldn't stop crying. In that moment I couldn't care less who saw me bawling and I had no control. In fact, I'm shedding tears writing this right now. However, I don't think I made a mistake. I just know that I'll miss them forever. But I know they'll be in a better home.

As for where I am now, suicidal thoughts are now easier, of course. I have no plans or anything, but the thought of not being alive anymore, escaping existence... Those thoughts are there. The only things that relied and depended on me are gone to a better home. No one needs me anymore.","I just surrendered my dogs, the only beings that I had left.",NorwegianLeotard

depression,"I've written several posts detailing various aspects of my own personal share of existence that I cannot call life. Thus, I learnt that posting posts on reddit does not necessarily help me. It just cannot change the situation I'm in. I do not want to trigger people, I do not want pity either.

As alays, perhaps this is an expression of the need for help. What kind of help? Even I do not know. Therapy sessions feel like pre-recorded messages are repetitively provided to me with the intent of somewhat ""calming me down"". As soon as I get helped up and out of the door, realizing my own disability and the oudside world, my simple conclusion that I'll never fit in and always feel out of place, even a little bit -- hits back, no words having changed the way this world is.

I'm sorry but having been born is not an enough reason to live. An enough reason to live would have been happy memories with family, close friends, falling in love, trying out love, finding someone who loves me and finds me perfect the way I am, getting married and having kids...

Some people may have that. Or just a thing from the list. That's more that I'll ever get. There's nothing that can flip a switch and change the memories of abuse, pain, suffering, loneliness, bullying, mockery and never being seen as enough. That's what I have up to now. No actual reason to believe something would ever change. A 26 year-old man with cerebral palsy is anything but most people's cup of tea. Other 26 year-olds need their parties, communication, fun, hikes or whatever it be. And they can get them in one way or another. Insecurity about body shape/ weight? They can do some sports/ lift weights at home. Their body would allow them to improve somewhat. This would probably make them sexy in some girl's eyes, which is a good start.

Being a successful (insert job here -- in my case, a PhD student, I suppose) has only something to do with that. As long as you have enough to live with, as long as you can somewhat do your job -- that's enough. I cannot live for my job, I am terribly sorry. I work and get paid. That's it. I cannot buy friends, love, affection, or new memories.

No reason to believe anything would change. How do I know? I've been studying and doing my best for 10 years now and nothing has changed. Me and my caretaker. That's all. And always will be. Until she dies. Then... Change would come. For the worse.",Thank you and sorry to whoever reads this. I hope I break soon enough so that I get pills or whatever so I can feel better.,Head_Blacksmith

I tried art, music, walking, and meditation, but everything feels like temporary measures to prevent the inevitable.

depression,"I'm 3 months into almost full remission now. The remaining symptoms are reciding at a good rate, and I can think of looking for a job again, so I figured now is a good time to give you guys a summary of what I tried, and what worked and what didn't, or not fully.

I've been suffering from depression since 2015, with some partial and short lived remissions, but now is the first time I can say I'm not depressed anymore. It had major repercussions on pretty much every aspects of my life : aborted my career, end of a dozen years long relationship, financial and housing problems... My symptoms included anhedonia, sadness, general anxiety, social anxiety, lack of motivation and energy, cognitive impairment/brainfog, memory impairment, insomnia (worsen by some medications), self-loathing, pretty severe suicidal thoughts, substance abuse, reckless behaviors, irritability, all sorts of ruminations and depressive thoughts, some episodes of catatonia, and med-induced weight gains.

**WHAT HELPED THE MOST**

* **Ketamine :** Ketamine is not approved for psychiatry where I live. It's not impossible to get some legally, it's under trial at the moment, but it's a real pain in the ass and there are waiting lists, so I bought some on the black market and self-medicated. This might have been the single best decision in my life. It made my life go from hellish to bearable in a matter of weeks. It didn't cure me, but it's by far the greater improvement I've witnessed. I started a few weeks before an appointment with a new psychiatrist, in a fait accomplis line of thought, to be monitored and get access to ADs on top of it. It went well, no objection. I was taking it every few days at first, then every week. I took a two months break to reset tolerance after a few months, which worked.
* **California rocket fuel (sertraline + mirtazapine) :** The first combo of monoaminergic antidepressant I added to ketamine. It took some time to find the right dose of each molecule, but once we did it really did improve every symptoms. Only side effect was some errectile dysfunction and drop of libido, but nothing too bad. I discontinued because there is some suspicion of some form of bipolarity, and my psychiatrists thought this could put me at risk of mania. The withdrawal was pretty harsh compared to every other med I've dicontinued so far.
* **Tranylcypromine + mianserin :** The replacement. I started with tranylcypromine alone. It gave me insomnia so I was prescribed quetiapine with it, but it wasn't really optimal for sleep and made me gain a lot of weight, to a point a reached obesity for the first time of my life. I had to argue a bit due to the overcautiousness around MAOIs' interactions, but I managed to get mianserin instead. It worked a bit better for sleep, was less problematic regarding weight (but not perfect by far), and it significantly improved my mood. Tranylcypromine is also better for focus, cognition and so on than the other ADs I tried. The symptoms that remained after the introduction of mianserin were chaotic sleep hours, unstable energy level, and the weight.
* **rTMS :** It caused some sleep disturbances during the therapy but significantly improved every symptoms. I could stop ketamine after this.

**OTHER THINGS THAT REALLY HELPED**

* **Ashwagandha :** The herb that finally managed to stabilize my sleep. I cannot say I have noticed any effect on weight, mood, cognition etc. on the other hand.
* **Zopiclone :** Not for long-term use, but as a punctual sleep aid it did come handy.on many occasions
* **Mirtazapine :** My first AD. My circadian cycle was completely obliterated at the time, and mirtazapine really helped with that, and tackled some of my depressive symptoms too for a short time, in monotherapy. It didn't last however. Except for tranylcypromine, I've had mirtazapine on top of every AD I had and it works wonder to both counteract AD-induced insomnia, and augment the antidepressant effect.
* **Alpha-GPC :** Really helps with brainfog, cognition, memory...
* **Huperzine A (from huperzia serrata) :** Same, but more energic, good for motivation
* **L-theanine :** Pretty good anxiolitic, and helps a bit with focus, especially when combined with coffee. Not too sedative.
* **Skullcap (scutellaria lateriflora) :** Also a pretty good anxiolitic with a pretty good anxiolisis/sedation ratio, and some slight stimulating property
* **Picamilon :** Not available in every country, but it's a very good short acting anxiolitic, also with some stimulation too, and that caries much less risks than the usual GABAergics. Helps a bit with focus too.
* **California poppy (eschscholzi californica) + valerian root (valeriana officinalis) + lemon balm (melissa officinalis) :** My go to herbal blend before I discovered ashwagandha. It's not perfect, but it's a mix of GABAergics that you can use long-term.
* **Journaling :** When you are really deep into depression, even writing a single sentence each day can be a challenge. But doing so helps in many ways. Writing your thoughts down helps free your mind of ruminations. It gives you some hindsight, and it makes suffering a bit less pointless : you're collecting data so future-you can use it to better fight depression, and better take care of bad days-you. It's also a good way to keep in mind all the progress you've made.
* **Behavioral activation :** Not really doable below some depth, but IMO the first thing to try if ADs alone aren't enough.
* **Cognitive restructuring :** The other big part of CBT. Helps with depressive thoughts. Doesn't suppress them, but helps taking some distance.
* **16:8 diet :** After the first few kg, I was stuck at the same weight for a time after stopping quetiapine. I started loosing wight again with this fasting diet. I stop eating at 14:00 until the next morning. I'm loosing 1kg every two days on average since. The first night was a bit difficult, but now I seem to sleep better that way too.

**HELPED A BIT**

* **Mindfulness :** Mainly enhanced the effect of cognitive restructuring
* **Fluoxetine :** Definitively improved my condition, but not quiet enough, and didn;t last. Insomnia (corrected with mirtazapine), erectile dysfunctions and reduced libido as side effects.
* **Venlafaxine :** Same
* **Lorazepam :** Really helped with sleep and anxiety, but tolerance and addiction comes fast. I had no trouble tapering though.
* **Alprazolam :** Same, so I only used on a short period
* **EPA+DHA (from alguae):** Noticeable effect on the mood, anxiety, irritability...
* **Creatine :** Helped with everything but sleep, and with weight too
* **Lion's mane :** Noticeabe effect on mood and cognition
* **&gt;1 hour of sun exposure per day :** helps with mood, anxiety and sleep
* **Exercising :** Good for mood, irritability, motivation and weight loss obviously
* **Pregabaline :** Excelent for social anxiety, sleep, significantly lifts mood too, but addictive so I only used it punctually. Phenibut is somewhat similar but not as good, but it is OTC in several countries. Try picamilon instead if you can.
* **5-HTP (from griffonia simplicifolia) :** noticeable effect on mood and anxiety
* **ASMR :** Really helps with sleep and anxiety if you are sensible to it. Don't hesitate to try different chanels.
* **Cold showers :** energy, motivation, maybe weight loss too
* **CBD :** When L-theanine or skullcap isn't quiet enough, can add some extra anxiolisis, but nothing spectacular either, and not enough on its own.
* **Konjac :** helps manage hunger from meds
* **Beta-alanine :** Weight loss
* **Stopping tobacco :** Improved my sleep

**HELPED SOMEWHAT, OR NOT TOO SURE**

Cyamemazine (anxiety), alimemazine (sleep), magnesium L-threonate and glycinate (sleep), white noise (anxiety), SuperBetter app, vitamine D3, reading about Young schemas, ginkgo biloba (energy, focus), melatonin (sleep), chamomile (sleep), verbena (sleep), lavender (sleep), ALCAR, taurine, NAC, cannabis (sleep), gratitude journal, music (anxiety), coleus forskohlii (weight loss), CLA (from safflower, weight loss), metformin (weight loss, triggered an hypoglicemia the first time I tried it), green tea, risperidone (anxiety, cravings, irritability)

**DID NOT SEEM TO HELP**

Inositol, chromium picolinate, zinc, CoQ10, apple cider vinegar, meratrim (sphaeranthus indicus + garcinia mangostana), hydroxyzine, tiapride

**MADE IT WORSE**

* **Quetiapine :** Made me oversleep at first, then wasn't enough for a whole night, so I upped the dose, which made me oversleep again, until it wasn't enough again... Made me gain a lot of weight, which added one more problem to my mess of a life. Hated it.
* **7-keto-DHEA :** I've got weird reactions to this one : sometimes heat and elevated heartbeat, which seems to be worse with caffein, and sometimes fatigue, brainfog or bad mood.
* **GHB :** Helped a lot with social anxiety for a time, until I got hooked and had to go through withdrawal, and boy you don't want to go through that. As for sleep, it does make you sleep if you take enough, but it's a really weird and unnatural kind of sleep in my opinion, with a rebound in the middle of the night.
* **Alcohol :** In terms of sheer anxiolisis, I don't think anything can beat it. But it was just too deshinibiting for me, and I couldn't keep all my self-destructive tendencies in check with it. At some point I was more afraid of the shit I would do if I drank than it was helping me be more social, completely defeating the purpose.","In remission after years of hell, here's what helped me and what didn't",chapodrou

depression,"Yes I'm sorry about using the term drama queen but its the best way to get my meaning across.

Before I start I need to get say This person may very well have a lot of real problems I'm not dismissing that this is all just a thought exercise...

\[Person A partner of 2 years to a best friend (Person B) \] has been causing a lot of issues over the past 2 years and non-stop rants on facebook with no filter...  
Person A, at first claimed to be bi-polar and now claims of several other disorders (all of which Doctors can not confirmed) she now says Doctors and family don't care about her. Her family have been witnessed to be very kind caring people this has been confirmed by Person B, there is also disliking between her and sister due to her sister taking a similar stance to what I have.

She does not work due to claiming being unfit to work and literally posts 7 - 10+ facebook post a day all being (apologies for the generalization) the stereotypical edgy emo teen (She is not a teen) life is hard don't judge me crap... Then you have the posts where she will claim no body cares about her and no body does anything for her Despite posting this every other day and the mountain of people trying to make sure she's ok (on and off facebook)

Person B has been obviously affected by it for a while and clearly sick of the stuff they have to put up with but goes along with it anyway. Disappears for a whole day at times and when being in a voice call with their friend group as soon as his phone rings (most of the time with an audible sigh) immediately turns off their device and claims their internet or device is playing up (despite us all hearing them press the power button). their older sister (who is a lovely person) also takes a disliking to their relationship and she knows them in a lot more detail that what information I have.

While my opinion is obviously leaning towards 1 side its still entirely private and like i said I'm not dismissing the fact her problems could be very real but the point of this is to discuss where the line should be drawn between taking behavior as being routed in various disorders and when the person simply being hard done by and being a obsessive narcissistic individual...

TL;DR: \[INSERT RELATED ANONAMOUS STORY HERE\] Where do we realistically draw the line between accepting a person does have various mental issues they have self diagnosed and confronting them about the fact that if they are not lying for attention then it may be them expecting too much from the world or maybe another underlying problem like Narcissisms, paranoia or obsession.

I apologies if I come across as insensitive but this is something I'd never confront someone about this is all a thought exercise... But this all comes from the fact I believe there has to be a line when it comes to these issues (I don't know where that line should to be) you can't just let everyone believe they have depression or other disorders there has to be a point where you have to tell people suck it up and focus on what causes these problems for them ... being overly accepting to everyone does more damage than good, it hides underlying issues that can be tackled directly","Where is the line between someone with Depression (And other mental disorders of the like) and being a Drama Queen/Attention Seeker (For lack of a better term, Yes i know it sounds awful)?",woolstarr

depression,"Someone made a derogatory comment about my appearance last night at dinner (I was a guest at a friend's house). This has been a pattern in my life - I seem to attract abuse and mockery even though I try work hard to be in shape, dress well, etc. I was mocked in middle school, high school, college, and even by a few colleuges over the years. 

From the tone, context, and manner in which I was insulted yesterday, it was clear that it was being demonstrated that my life has far less value than this other person's (other wise, why say it?). Now, I am confident in my skills as a quantitative analyst and programmer that I do have some value - particularly in the skills marketplace. So I can add that to my ""score"" of worthiness if you will. Also, I am a talented piano player - so I can also put that in my ""score"" of worthiness and reason to keep living. However, no matter how hard I work at these things, if there is a throughline of people looking at me and saying ""this person deserves our abuse, we should subject him to continued harrasment and demonstrate his worthlessness to him"", it's hard to calculate and counteract those deleterious signals with enough feelings of self-worth. Think of it as continually working againt a negative score of worth.

depression,"I used to love going home. Now, all I feel is emptiness and sadness when I look at the places I used to hang out as a kid. I do not know what exactly has changed, perhaps me, and the illusion has fallen apart in time, given that my experience is far larger than when I was a kid. To give a bit of a context, I've been away from home for almost a year in another rented place to continue my studies, and there I have two cats, an awesome PC I've managed to build last year from parts, a job, independence and everything an adult technically requires to ""adult"". Now, when I've returned home, I cannot see the appeal. I no longer understand my folks, and they neither I. The house seems smaller, constricted and overall, quite sad. And I didn't tell my parents, but I did cry these nights by myself. I'm constantly being hit by nostalgia of happy memories in which I didn't have much, yet I was content; I'm constantly assaulted by the guilt that I should enjoy my time here, as all of this will be gone one day. Without a trace.

  


  


The worst part is, this feeling is not linked only to this place; it seems to have invaded the rented place as well. I stay up at nights, and I keep wondering: is this it? I seem to no longer connect to anybody from here, I'm in no mood to talk most of the days, and all I want the majority of time is to sleep, and sometimes play games on my PC, but even that is losing its glamour. I have a Masters, which now I see it as futile, and it really is, as that diploma would not help me with anything at all in the future; I've started it since my ill father wished it. But I can't blame him, it was my choice.

  


  


I used to feel like I belong when I was with my GF. She is great, gorgeous and everything I ever wanted in a partner: smart, dependable; she does have her problems as well, but who doesn't? The pros always outweighed the cons. But, lately, I feel like all I'm doing is compromise after compromise, I feel like we're no longer compatible on various areas of our lives, perhaps, due to the fact, that I'm in no mood to do anything these days. And it's understandable, she's young, and so am I; she wants to travel, have fun, and I... just want to sleep, and I'm always tired. I feel like I'm robbing her of her most fun and memorable years if she stays with me, and the guilt that comes from that just makes me get colder to her, leading to fights, arguments and hurt feelings.

so, I went and bought a rope despite the fact that I live with my mum and if she finds a box with a rope, with my literal name on it, at the front door I don't think that would gel very well. kind of hard to explain. 

on the bright side is I've been eating what I want because I've planned out what i'm gonna do, so might as well dine like a king amirite? had almond croissants and jam, shit's delicious.

honestly I don't know what the purpose of this post is, it almost feels like a ""wow I'm really doing this, pinch me"". it feels like the biggest relief I've had in a long time.

i've had an eating disorder that (for lack of a better word) has eaten me completely, I've lost so many friends over last year, I don't enjoy anything I used to enjoy anymore, school is a bust because I just don't attend or do work, all I've done for months is lie in bed and purge all my food. 

and sure, what if it gets better? I recover, work on myself so I can live a full, mediocre life? I don't have any talent, experience, or motivation that will actually get me anywhere I want to be, hell I can't even go a day in the outside world without needing 2 days of bedrest.

depression,"I'm going to be 27 this year. Still live my parents, and have been single forever. Life's not so bad, I have a decent job, adequate number of friends, I'm healthy. I also have what I thought was decent savings. But looking at rent and houses prices, it's nothing. Stupid choices I made means I have student loans and a car to pay off, so I can't afford much in terms of monthly payments. 

So I lost pretty much all hope for the future. I though having a decent job was when I finally ""made"" it, but it all feels pointless. I'll probably never own a house or have a family. Its eating away at me every day. I try distractions but it only feels like a band aid on a gaping wound.

I've decided that when I turn 30, if I still live with my parents and I'm single, it's over for me. Not sure if it will motivate me, but it is comforting to know I only have 3 more years to endure this mental bullshit of good/bad/good/bad, feeling like shit with small moments of joy that never last.

depression,"For the past couple of weeks I've been working hard on a schedule that works for me and that I even enjoy (concerning food, chores, movement and work). I felt significantly less depressed, anxious and frustrated and more relaxed and even joyful. I know these things don't cure depression or anything, but they helped me. After a while I didn't even need to discipline myself to do them. I even looked forward to the things on my schedule and felt accomplished and calm at the and of the day. 

Anyway last week something stressful happened and since then it's been going downhill. No joy, no motivation, no drive, nothing. At first I tried to stick to my plan regardless, but yesterday I just had to surrender. I wasn't even able to eat, because nothing was appealing and everything was too much work. In the end I got takeout after going back and forth about what to get for an hour. I haven't washed my hair, because I just can't bother and so on.

Of course I know this by now. It comes and eventually it goes. But I just want it to be a little less devastating if somehow possible. So here is what I need advice on:

would you try to force yourself to stick to the schedule knowing that it helps my brain produce serotonin and dopamine and helps even if I don't feel it in the moment? Hoping that the episode is maybe less brutal or shorter than the last one. and hoping it will help me stay afloat and able to deal with the aftermath of this episode better. Also hoping that it helps me stay healthy in the long run (physically healthy).

Or would you try to sit it out and be compassionate and not force yourself to do the stuff you know is good for you, but is just so hard right now? Hoping that being kind and generous with yourself will keep you from hating yourself for ""failing"". Hoping that it will better your relationship with yourself and your connection to your true needs?

I wish this pandemic never happened. I'd still be in my home city, would've had a proper final year of highschool and would be able to meet up with my friends in the 4 months we have left before uni. 

Basically thanks to the wonderfully hellish combination of depression, anxiety and ADHD, I struggled like hell with the last few years of highschool and majorly fucked up my grades. I've been trying and busting my ass off to do whatever I can to get average grades at the very least for my final exams, which has been insanely tough to do since I used to be a straight A student until sophomore year. My parents are pissed, they don't support me in the slightest because ""mental health is not real and you just need to try harder"". 

My dad knows that my friends and dogs are the 2 things he can hold over my head and I'll do anything to not lose them; they're honestly what's keeping me somewhat mentally stable, and the reason I didn't kill myself sooner. He's never exploited that until recently though. I'm not allowed to go out or do anything fun, if I call them too often I get scolded for being on my phone too much. If I refuse to do something he wants, all I hear is ""I have people ready to take the dogs away, you want me to do it?"" 

I asked why I'm so restricted when I'm officially done with school and I have limited time left in my home city before I have to go back and the response was ""we're not happy with your academics, so we don't think you should be out enjoying"". 

What difference does it fucking make? There's literally nothing I can do to change what's already done. If I fucked up, I'll be miserable when the results come out whether or not I had fun after my exams ended. And if I did well, I'll be miserable about how much I missed out on. 

Every scenario ends in me being miserable. I can't spend time with the people I love no matter how much I want to. Even if I could take solace in having a great academic career, that's not happening because I can't get the help I need in order to do so. 

I'm just tired and done. I've never wanted to not-exist more.

depression,"About a year ago I had a couple people I used to hang out with or more hang around at school. This was my senior year of high school and they were the only people I really talked to at school. Pretty much three kids I’d started hoping to lunch with every day at school for pretty much all of high school. Although there were times they would hang out outside of school often honestly and I was never invited. Every friday night I’d see their stories on snapchat of them all hanging out and having fun. After a while I would hit them up now and then and they always said they were busy or some other excuse. There were two of the three I though really didn’t like me but one of them, we‘ll say his name is Jake, I thought actually was chill w/ me. That is until one Friday I asked him if he wanted to hang out and he said that he already had a family dinner or something and then I saw another kids story and they were all hanging out. I subsequently sent him a Snapchat a few days later just saying that if they weren’t chill with me or didn’t want me hanging around wiht them to just say so bc I didn’t want to be a burden. He responded by saying he thought I was cool and all but he really didn’t want to hang out with me outside of school, he aLos said he thought that there were other people that would like me and I should try to hang out with other people.

Anyways I tried but n senior year friend groups are kind of like solidified and people aren’t exactly making new friends. I pretty much just started working on my artwork at lunch and in free time as well as studying more, working at my local community center, and working out. Overall I guess this probably bettered my life; I got into AP studio art, I got into REALLY good shape, and my grades got a little better. But none of this prevented countless nights of just feeling worthless crying myself to sleep. I have supportive parents and loving family, but I just feel like that’s unconditional and anytime it comes down to my personality and who I am people like me but just not enough to consider me a real friend.

depression,"Hi everyone,

I am turning 18 in a few months, however, I am wondering if there is any way I can get support from a GP before then without my parents knowing?

I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety when I was 14, but I haven't sought help since. In short, I had a bad experience with therapy, and my parents stopped taking me, so I haven't received any support since. 

Flashforward 4 years, and my parents have no idea that I'm still struggling. In fact, they think I'm better now. I'm not close to them at all, so I don't exactly feel comfortable talking to them about this.

They also reacted very badly when I first told them about my mental health concerns, so I feel like at this point I have no choice but to go behind their backs and get help.

Sooo basically my question is... How do I go about getting support from a GP in this situation? (Particularly because I am still 17 so I'm worried about the whole 'confidentiality' thing).

I think we all have a desire to feel normal and here we can be ourselves and not have to hide how we are really feeling.

I wish I could offer words of comfort. I wish I could say something that would make it all better. But I would be lying. 

Depression is very personal and intimate. Even talking about it is like opening a fresh wound. Everyone has their issues, but for me I believe my depression is internal, chemical, something just wrong with my brain. Sure I have experienced tragedy and hardships but I can honestly say I don't even think about those things. My brain is the problem.  I have suffered with this since childhood.

This year my depression has been the worse it has been since I was in high school. Puberty really kick started my depression. But for a time it went dormant in the back of my mind. But it was always there like a shadow. But sometimes the shadow envelops me. Like now. 

I  am on sertraline. It helped a lot in the beginning. But its faded now. I take high doses of CBD in pill form from CBD genesis. They sell 1500 milligram bottles, but it expensive at between 70$ and 80$. I have to take a lot for it to work. And the only reason it helps is because at such high doses it dumbs my brain down and clears my thoughts. 

I have a successful job. Make good money. I have people in my life that want me in their life. But I push them away. I hate myself so my brain tells me if I hate myself everyone else does too. How do I function to hold a job? I created personas in my head that are stronger than me. The real depressed me hides away and I pretend to be someone else during work. 

But it is all falling apart. I've started missing work. I wear a lot of hats being the manager, accountant, data entry and what ever else I am needed for. So me not being at work has people alarmed. I have telling everyone I have stomach problems as an explanation. Truthfully my stomach does hurt a lot because I am so worried and hurt and angry and tired. 

I dread Mondays. I don't exactly want to die but rather I wish I could freeze time so everyday was Saturday night. At night nothing happens. I could watch TV and sleep forever. But I know that can't happen so I have been thinking of ending it. It kind of a relief knowing that that is how I will die one day. 

I am in pain when not on CBD. I hurt. I feel like my feelings are hurt but the only one who has hurt me is myself. How do I get away from myself? I have self sabotaged myself by overeating and now have diabetes and high blood pressure. I hurt. 

My bedroom is a mess. I haven't done laundry in a month. I used to pride myself on having good hygiene. But sometimes I don't bathe, or shave. This is a new low for me. I have been a functional severely depressed person. But now I can't function. I hate my depression but at the same time I wallow in it like a pig. 

I want to finish this up by saying that I have reached the end of the line. I can't take anymore. I am so tired. I have decided to try and get help. I don't know why but I will get help. I will speak to my doctor. He is the only person that knows the real me. I trust that he will at least try for me. He has been the kindest man I have ever met.

depression,Hi I’m a 22 year old student from Sweden. I have been feeling lonely and depressed for the past 2 and a half years. When will this ever end? I’ve also had trouble sleeping during that same time. Any advices there? I tried going to sleep early and make it a habit but my mind won’t shut off. Just thinks about everything for about 4 hours before I eventually fall asleep of exhaustion. It’s 5:am right now and I’ve barely slept 4 hours. Now I can’t fall asleep again. I’m thinking about taking proscribed medication but I’m afraid of the side effects and the addiction. If u have any advices on how to fall asleep just comment them...pls. The reason as to why I can’t sleep is my depression I believe. If there is anyone out there having the same problems and feeling lonely do you have any advices? Pls help...seriously lol.

depression,Sitting here all alone in my room just thinking about everything that's happened in the 20 years I've been alive and I can't say anything good has happened. I had major depression issues in 11th grade of hs and I used to cut myself and all that fun stuff. I felt alone and no matter what I did nobody cared or reached out. The only person who was there for me was my girlfriend but I even shut her out. End of November my girlfriend broke up with me. We were at a rough patch and covid really made things worse. She was the prettiest girl I've ever laid my eyes on and the fact that she was mine felt amazing. Sure she had flaws but the good outweighed the bad most of the time. Towards the end it felt like I was chasing the what I used to feel and I knew that wasn't good but I also knew I loved her so much and didn't want to lose my bestfriend. We were together for 4 years and she got me through so much idk if I'd be here without her. I tried moving on and all the girls I talked to either friemdzoned me or just found a new guy. Recently I found out she blocked or unadded me on social media and my heart just broke when I found that out. I don't want to hurt myself just over a girl but she is a big part of it. I hate my life and I don't know where I'm going. Most days I just drive around listening to music or stare at my ceiling. My heart is just broken.

depression,"Hey. 
I [17M] have been finding it really hard to cate about anything lately, school, friends, family, anything really. I just missed out on two huge potential opportunities in my sport at the last competition of the season, and I've really just been doom spiraling ever since. My teammates all just had the best season in our team's history, meanwhile I didn't even score a single point in our final competition, when I was favored to do very well. On top of that, I feel really disconnected from everyone since that competition. I wasn't super close friends with anyone on the team, (we had kind of mutual respect, but i never hung out with them outside of practices and meets) and my closest friends irl I'm struggling to talk to.  I've been struggling with them for a while, theres a main group of about 8 people and we usually do everything together, but over the last 6 months or so I've just grown to not like barely any, theres like maybe 1 or 2 I don't hate. There's a kind of shared culture within that group, and I just feel like I'm not a part of it. it's been months since I've had a real talk with anyone, one where it seemed like i was talking to another person. 

I'm normally a pretty chill guy, so everyones is all surprised and patronizing when I tell them what I'm feeling, as if I've never been here before. It seems wrong to turn down their support but it never helps. 

Every time I hear someone say ""good job"" after that competition i just have to suck it up and nod along, even though internally I'm screaming, NO, IT WASN'T A GOOD JOB.  I've dedicated years of my life to training and it all led up to this moment and i just completely fucked it up. there's no re-do. It just feels like shell shock, I haven't been able to get myself to do anything since then. I can't tell if this is depression or if I'm being overdramatic.

depression,"Last night I was having constant bad thoughts that I couldn't control. I couldn't find anything to keep myself occupied as I've basically lost interest in everything. After a while of being unable to sleep I decided to just go for a drive. While driving around, I went from being totally numb to literally the lowest point I've ever been. I was crying so much that I couldn't see so I parked up. Straight ahead of me was a bridge above a road and from there it was like a trance. I stood on the bridge and I realised that it wasn't gonna be high enough to kill me from the fall, so I planned to wait for a bus to come along the road. After about 5 minutes, a police van saw me and stopped and I walked away from the bridge so that they would leave, after a couple minutes I looped back around and waited again on the bridge, only to realise I had missed one of the few buses that take this road. From here I remember just looking down at the road for a while until I heard someone shout. The police officers had also looped back around. I told them to stop walking towards me but they would not listen. Coincidentally at this very exact moment, the next bus was coming along the road. All I could hear in my head was 'Now'. I remember feeling my heart pounding so hard as I started climbing the railings, only to be yanked backwards onto the floor.

The officers kept asking me for things like my name, address and age. I didn't talk at all, I couldn't. I was literally weak. All I could think about is how they just ruined it. I tried to get up off of the floor to get away but they would not let me. After about 10 minutes of me refusing to give my details, they told me that I was under arrest for 'breach of the peace'. They cuffed my right hand without me realising, but as soon as I felt it, I started trying to get away and tucked my other arm underneath me as I was lying on the floor. They ended up pulling my arm out and in the process it got all scraped and cut which I did not feel at all. Once they handcuffed me they took me back to their van and searched me and took all of my things off of me. Put me in the cage at the back of the van and took me to the police station.

When we arrived they put me in the holding area before you get booked in and I overheard one of the officers talking to the custody Sergeant. The Sergeant then told them they could not arrest me for breach of the peace as that crime had not actually taken place. I remember feeling so relieved because this meant they could no longer hold me here and I could just go. That was until he then said to hold me under Section 136 of the Mental Health Act. They threatened to take me to one of the local psychiatric hospitals to the point where they put me back into the van and they told me they can keep me for 24 hours and even get a further 12 hour extension. At this point I told them my first name and that was it. They started to be nicer to me and offered that I could talk to their street triage team. I agreed to do that instead of going to the psychiatric hospital and so we waited in a nice part of the police station in like a waiting room. They told me that there were two people coming from the street triage team and that they would be around 30 minutes. While waiting they managed to get me talking more and they didn't seem like such assholes as they did before. It took 45 minutes for the street triage team to arrive and when they did we sat in a private room and talked for about an hour. I told them I didn't want anyone to know about this and they understood that. In the end they referred me for talking therapies which should get in contact with me. They emailed my GP and told me to make an appointment and also gave me some coping strategies.

From there, I got back into the police van (in the backseats this time) and I was dropped back off where they picked me up because my car was parked there. They followed me until I got a couple streets away from my house. It's now the next day and I haven't told ANYONE and I'm just so confused and kind of scared. I'm still stuck in a kind of trance, I'm zoning out literally every minute, can't hold any conversations with people it's really not even living. I feel like I should've just died last night because it doesn't even feel like I'm here anymore. I keep replaying it all in my head, especially the moment where I was so close to jumping. If the police did not show up, I would probably be dead. I have work in 4 hours how am I supposed to go into work and act normal? What if people question the cuts on my arms?

depression,"  We moved to a different state about 3 years ago. We had everything from 2 Years old and up in storages.. all of it is gone now. 

Our mother neglects her duties as a parent most of the time, which we've dealt with since age 7 when she came back into our life. She was an abusive drunk for most of our life and is part of the reason our mental health is shit. As the years have gone by in our new state, we've been evicted, homeless, living in a van and shitty motels and then we dropped out of high school, all in the span of 1 year. After everything, we still had hope that our mother would pull her head out of her ass.. but to no surprise, it still hasn't happened. She said she had everything handled, and told our dad the same. 

We've asked her on multiple occasions that we wanted to get my stuff out of storage. (Our Childhood stuff and expensive stuff). She would always brush me off and we figured it was just her being lazy, but earlier this week we asked our dad if he had seen our boots. He said no and we told him not to worry about it because that meant it was in storage. He then told us that a couple of months ago our mother lost it. he didn't know that we hadn't been told yet. Our mother still hasn't answered our texts or calls back..

Our dad lost 50 YEARS worth of artwork he had worked on since he was young and all his musical instruments, my sisters lost a lot and so did we...

Anyway when it came time to choose a career, I chose audiovisuals, I can't even remember WHY, because it was so long ago (I'm now 29), probably because I just liked movies or the concept of making a film and being creative. My mom, who financially supported me (then and NOW, more on that later) said ""absolutely not, you'll never get a decent pay that way and I'm not gonna support you if you go down that path, you'll be on your own"" (tbh this probably was just an empty threat and she'd probably have supported me anyway, cause she is pretty caring, I just think she wanted a ""better future"" for me, whatever that means). Anyway that was my first mistake, I should have stood my ground then and there, even if it meant failing (and nowadays I don't think that was a great choice to be honest). But I followed her advice and chose a ""real career"", being a veterinarian. Now, I don't know if that was my PASSION, I just liked animals, that's it, I had a lot of pets. Anyway before the first year started, my mom started graining on my mind ""why don't you start an engineer career? they pay well, you are smart, and you'll be guaranteed a good job"". She suggested that because the ""admittance course"" for engineering (don't know how to call it) was in February, just before starting Vet. So she convinced me to just try it, if I didn't like it I just drop out and that's it.

That was the second and the HUGEST mistake, because once I started that course, the ""sunken cost fallacy"" gradually started polluting my mind: ""I already did this course, I wasted a month, I need to keep going!"" (I know, I'm a fucking idiot). So I was admitted to engineering and I started BOTH careers at the same time. The thing is, no one in their right mind can do 2 careers at the same time. At least I couldn't. On one hand, I already had friends in engineering, and the classes were mandatory (you had to be there). On the other hand, in Veterinary I knew no one and you could practically study in your home and skip classes, and just go for the exams, at least for the first year which is like a huge admittance course.

Also this needs some context: when I finished high school, I was the tipical nerd (few friends, all nerds, no contact with girls, etc). The very first time I went to Vet school, I talked to some girls and we spent the whole day together (something which was completely new to me) and then I NEVER saw them again because I stopped going to focus on the engineering mandatory classes and my ""friends"" there.

(this will come into play later)

Anyway the first 2 years were OK I guess, doing both things. On the third year, after finishing the Vet admitance course (which took 2 years instead of one due to the engineering), I dropped out of vet and kept on doing the engineering career. Just to be clear I was already pretty demotivated by this time, and I started going to the psychologist, which didn't do much good and besides the one that had to make a DECISION (which I'm horrible at) was me. And at THAT time, having wasted 2 and a half years was a LOT (sorry past me, but you are a fucking dumbass). So I kept on going, and going, and going.

Meanwhile my OUTSIDE life was OKish, still wasting time playing games like a dork, hanging out with friends (from school, NOT from engineering), dating VERY FEW chicks, which I don't know of I even managed to do that. When I was 21-22 I gradually stopped being a loser and became a ""normal"" person (if you can call me that). But when going to classes I suffered very much, and I just couldn't stop, I was trapped there, terrified of dropping out and at the same time terrified of the future if I didn't drop out.

I finished my courses after 7 years (wasted) but I STILL had to finish a LOT of exams on each subject (sorry if you don't understand what the hell I'm saying but I don't know the ""school"" terms of US, UK and other countries. So fast forward to today, 4 YEARS after that (11 years FUCKING WASTED). I'm officially a fucking engineer, I don't even know how or why, I don't even know for what purpose. The constant grinding and resentment I had for the career, made me hate it, hate my peers, hate myself, hate my Mom for putting me on that path (though I could easily have stopped anytime, but if she didn't even suggested it I wouldn't be where I am today, butterfly effect I guess).

And since I hated the career so much, I didn't even look for a job, EVER, cause I KNEW I'd despise it and feel unhappy for the rest of my life. So now, I'm a fucking 29 year old loser, that hasn't ANY kind of job experience, that feels like he completely lost his youth doing something he didn't like (who the fuck does that?), that missed on a lot of experiences (I'm 100% sure my life would be completely different If I went the vet route, more girl friends, more enthusiasm, more parties, etc you get what I mean).

Worst of all I can't tell this to anyone (except my close friends and family) cause then I'll show how FUCKING retarded I am and these last few weeks I have been crying every day cause I don't know what the fuck to do, I feel miserable. At 18 I was happy, in my own way at least, and I never would have thought I'd be feeling this way 10 years later (not even when I was half way through engineering).

Now, I know I'm ""young"" and all that BS, I know I can still change my life around. But I don't have many options, specially financially. I can look for engineering positions and be miserable (which by the way, maybe the job is completely different to what I think it would be and I'd actually enjoy it, but my complete hatred of the career makes this almost impossible, or I can just get a job doing whatever and getting the piece of paper that is my degree, rolling it, and shoving 11 years up my ass (which doesn't even guarantee I'd be happy). And I can't stop thinking about ELEVEN. WASTED. YEARS. I know they won't come back, and I know I have even more years ahead of me yet to lose. But I find myself at a standstill, not knowing which direction to go. I already picked a random ass direction and it took me here, I can't afford to make any more mistakes. And I look at people that choose right from the get go, or that didn't like their careers and changed immediately, and I feel even worse.

By the way I actually went to vet school again 6 months ago. I like it, I like the subjects, I'm making a lot of friends (girls even) sadly only through the internet do to the pandemic. And I can't stop thinking how good it would have been if I studied this instead from the get go. But now I'm a 29 year old creep studying with young girls (not saying there's anything wrong with that, there's no age limit to start a career, but I'm completely OUT of the partying life style now, I mean doesn't hurt to try I guess but it's just not the same as being 18 again). Nevertheless, I CAN'T say for certain if being a vet is my passion or my future. But that's the main difference, because with engineering I could say it WASN'T from the very first moment I set foot in there.

So anyway, this was way to long. I just wanted to vent off I guess, not really sure what I'm looking for really. Advice? Also sorry to any engineers here, don't take it personal. It's just how I feel and I envy everyone of you that did it because they were passionate about it, it just isn't my thing. I'm just a good student I guess, but other than that I suck at life.","Hated the career I've chosen from the very first minute but graduated anyway, I've wasted my life.

depression,"I literally cannot experience any emotion without cutting myself down in my head. It's like my brain tries to see how low it can get itself. Any positive feeling is pretty much immediately ruined in my head. Any negative feeling is amplified. The thoughts are so intrusive that I've basically given up trying to regulate them. I've gotten increasingly more and more nihilistic about life in every aspect because I don't see the point in trying anymore, even though I am fairly successful in what I strive for. Anytime I KNOW I should feel proud of something, thoughts like ""I don't deserve it"" are always there. If not that, then I find something about the situation that I can contort in my head that I can't change to be a source of extreme anxiety. I.E., ""Yeah you got a degree in engineering, but you're not going to be able to put it into practice. You're going to make a huge mistake and potentially be thrown in jail for negligent homicide"". That kind of thing.

 Any goal I reach never feels like enough, and if I slow down I feel worthless. It's a vicious cycle that I cannot see an ending too. I've convinced myself that this is the way I will feel until I die, but even then I won't be happy with it. The thought that my existence is just a blip in the universe is one of the only comforting things I can latch onto.

 I've been on a couple different medications for depression/anxiety over the years but never take them for long because even though they take the edge off of the symptoms, I absolutely cannot stand the feeling of them. Like I'm not happy unless I'm unhappy. I don't know what to do.

My father had passed away when I was around 2 years of age and can remember it vividly. It's a memory that I will never forget and will always treasure in my mind. My mother then met another man who I can honestly say was the BIGGEST FUCKING PIECE OF FUCKING SHIT IN MY FUCKING LIFE. 

He used to abuse my mother all the time and I would witness it. He molested me multiple times and my mother didn't know. One day when I was 5 years old, he took me away from my mother and held my captive at his house in a basement for over 3 YEARS!. I try so FUCKING HARD to live with this trauma but it's just so FUCKING unbearable. I was molested multiple times each day for 3 years straight and was kept in the basement for nobody to find out. No sunlight, no windows, no TV, no clock. Just a light, very little food, water, bucket (toilet), and bed. I had been in this situation for 3 whole years without anyone knowing and I was just crying and begging. Every fucking day of my life I was begging to god to just free me from this dungeon but I felt god didn't listen. I felt a sense of hopelessness. I was starved and then fed, then starved, then fed. Raped 2 - 3 times a day. No sunlight - 24/7. After a very slow 3 years of praying and hoping, I was finally discovered by police who was raiding the house for drugs as the man who kidnapped me was a drug dealer and would often bring people round his house. He would turn the music up loud so that nobody hears my voice screaming. When I saw daylight for the FIRST FUCKING TIME I couldn't believe it. It felt so bright. I couldn't comprehend the feeling of how good it was to feel the freshness of the air and breathe in the fresh air. I'm now 32 years old and suffer from very serious mental illness. It's left so much trauma to me. So much anger. So much hate. So much everything. It was the worst thing a human should ever have to go through. The days were so long. I couldn't do anything. 3 YEARS of my life wasted in a small basement. I just want to fucking murder the person who did this to me in the worst way possible. I want him to suffer from the most intense pain ever and I hope no soul has to go through what I went through. My mother had sadly passed away as I was being held captive for 3 years. She couldn't deal with the emotional distress of me being missing for so long. I had to be put in several foster homes and some were pretty abuse but one of them actually took care of me and turned me into the person I am today. I am currently studying for my PhD in university and I will not let anything get through me even though I still suffer from several very severe mental illnesses.

If you're wondering what I'm so interested in...   Its Pokemon. I really like Pokemon.

As I was saying earlier, nobody shares my interests. When I try to talk to my brother about my interests, he either flat out ignores me, or interrupts me and says that he doesn't care. If I try to talk to my mom about it, she just pretends to listen.

When I started feeling lonely, I started using Reddit, where I knew their were giant communities dedicated to the franchise that I love. But, my parent's don't want me talking to people online because its ""unsafe"". So now, I have to use Reddit in private. Usually late at night or just whenever I'm alone. But, talking to strangers on Reddit, isn't the same as meeting somebody and having an actual conversation. I think the worst part about my loneliness is that I can only connect with people on Reddit, when I'm alone. And, I can't just go to some app or website to make up arrangements with people that share my interests, because like I said before, they don't want me having conversations with people online.

I can't just talk to my friends and family about it. Because, I'm scared that they'll call me selfish for feeling lonely, when I'm constantly around so many people. And, I'm afraid that my friends will be hurt, and that I'll lose the only friends I have, which will just make me more lonely. So, is it selfish to feel lonely, even though I have friends?

Well I had a relapse but then this it was in the form of waves of anxiety attacks.  I've never had this before and it feels so different.  My mind is constantly racing between thoughts, my body is constantly fatigued from trying to hold back another attack, and I don't know how to handle any of it.  I don't have any experience with this. When I was severely depressed my mind didn't wonder.  My thoughts weren't racing. I was calm in a way. Sad, but calm.  I also knew why I was depressed for the most part but now that my anxiety attacks have triggered my depression again, it's a different kind of depression. One that I haven't seen before and idk how to deal with.  I don't even know why I'm depressed.  And this time it is affecting everything.

I need a 3.7 GPA to keep my scholarships and at least a C to get credit for my classes which were already taking every in me to keep up with before I felt this way.  I know that I won't be able to keep the grades I need and even taking easy classes will be difficult but it's my best option.  I'm scared about eventually telling my family, however, and dropping my classes means I'll stay in college for another year which is very typical for my major anyway but it's just that I had so many plans laid out and now they're all going to change.  I'm really nervous about the future and worried that I won't make good progress with my mental health by next semester.  I didn't think things could get worse from the last time I was struggling but unfortunately I was wrong.

depression,"  

Last night my phone rang with only one ring, it was my father so I decided to call him back, and nothing could have prepared me for what followed. My dad proceeded to spend 10 minutes telling me that I forgot to call my grandfather on his birthday and how I should be better than this, and no one has heard from me in a month. Let me clarify something, I get one phone call from my parents and brother a year, on my birthday, other than that I am expected to call every other week if not every week. I tried to tell my dad that the phone works both ways if they were so concerned about me they could have called me. My dad continued to tell me that I should be the one to call because of how unreliable my schedule is….. my schedule has been the same for the past 8 years. When I pointed out that I get one phone call a year, my dad said to me “so you’re keeping score?” No father if I were keeping score I would say something like “hey I’ve called you 14 times and you have called me 10 it’s your turn to call me. The only time anyone called me more than once in a year was last year because my best friend killed himself and I was one of the last people to see him alive.” My family has a history of depression but I apparently won the lottery on that since mine affects me so much more than the others. Or they don’t really know what depression is and how it affects a person. I finally snapped and opened up to my dad saying I come home from work feeling worthless, like I shouldn’t exist, but I wear a smile for my family, for my daughter. Most days I don’t feel like doing anything but I muddle through chores, playing with my daughter. I keep myself distracted and busy to avoid thinking about how much I hate myself. My father asked why I haven’t sought out treatment. (I’ve been taking antidepressants for about a year now to include 3 medications, and have requested a psychiatrist three times) I explained the situation to him and he again was confused why I waited this long to seek help (I’m 31). I told him that I didn’t know there was anything wrong with me, until my wife suggested gently that I seek help. He said you weren’t like this until I got out of the military, I told him that he was wrong I was just better at hiding it. At this point I was boiling with anger and self-loathing so I yelled at him “sorry that I am just a big fuck up to you, sorry that I am not able to just shrug off all the abuse I went through growing up both mental and physical. Sorry that I haven’t fully dealt with the fact that when in high school I had been beaten, bones broken, lit on fire, and I was mad that you did nothing because you and mom worked all the time and didn’t sit down and talk to me unless I was in trouble for something. Guess that’s where my constant anxiety comes from, thinking that every time someone wants to talk to me I am in trouble” He was shocked to say the least but never apologized, I told him that of course he’s shocked I don’t like talking about it, I didn’t want to worry him or mom about me, I didn’t want to be a burden to anyone. This is my cross to bear……. I told him that I am trying to seek help that I am trying to get better but it sure as shit doesn’t help, when I do call, that I get berated with “it’s not cool that you forgot about us, we raised you better than this.” Or when I call my grandparents “oh so you remember us, well you will be sorry when were dead”. At this point I had been talking to him for an hour and I needed to eat dinner and put my daughter to bed, so I tried to end the conversation but my father just tried to say you should open up and talk about this more, maybe you should talk to your brother about all this….. yeah, no…. the last time I opened up to my brother I said “I think I have depression.” His response was “were all depressed”. Doesn’t exactly inspire confidence in the fact that I can open up. So I ended the conversation with my dad and put my daughter to bed and went back to keeping myself busy. I will continue to move forward and try to seek help, but it is clear I cannot rely on my parents or brother to understand me. Which hurts a lot but is also a relief as I no longer have to wonder what they think of me. I know they truly don’t understand me and don’t truly care.

depression,"My wife and I are currently living with my sister and brother-in-law. We have a husky puppy who is beyond hyper. They have two yorkies and my husky likes to play with them... only they don't like to play with her. There's constant incidents yapping and my dog accidentally hurting them (real great for the anxiety). I'm constantly worrying about what trouble my dog is going to get into.

My wife has borderline personality disorder, and is often a roller-coaster of emotions. We've had non-stop marital issues since we got married, and it's only intensified since we moved in with my sister. Not to mention my family constantly having some kind of issue with her and her emotions (especially when she lashes out)

My sister is always moody. My brother in law is always laid back, but he's hard to get a read on. I always feel like there's something we're doing to upset them. 

My mom was always my go-to for venting... but now she's started creating drama. I told her that it's hard living with my sister and brother-in-law... so she tells them that I said they're hard to live with. All this comes to a head when my brother-in-law exploded on us last night. I want to cut my mom off after this betrayal of trust... but both my mom and dad have cancer, and I deal with constant grief from my brothers murder. I don't want to react emotionally and regret cutting them out if they pass in the near future.

There's obviously more nuance to everything and more details. But TLDR I live with my family and there's a lot of tension now. I feel so betrayed and like my family hates me and my wife now.

I don't even know if he ever loved me back then. To him, I was probably just another notch in his belt. But to me, he was the first person I ever loved. Back then, I just loved being with him so much, even though I knew he wasn't treating me fairly. Isn't that funny?

I failed sixth grade. Don't know why I still care but that took away all of my friends. I felt like nobody had the time for me anymore since the only time I was with them was in class. They all kind of just drifted away from me. Now I'm in eighth grade and at an online school that my mom pays like fucking $500 a month for. 

I'm scared of leaving the house. Only times I leave the house is for counselling and even then it's hard. I have to leave for counselling in a couple hours. It's pretty damn crazy that I'm in this situation. 

I haven't enjoyed anything in years. Minutes feel like hours, hours like days, and days like months. I just want it to stop. I can't enjoy anything. No matter how much money I spend on random shit, it'll never enjoy anything.

At this time last year, I was starting to plan my suicide attempt. And now, I'm not actively suicidal and not as dreadfully depressed as I was before. Give or take some mood swings throughout the day/week.

Since suicide isn't as appealing as it once was, this means, I'm going to have to commit to an entire life time. It's incredibly terrifying. It is such a huge commitment. I feel like a jackass because I've fought for quite a while to feel better and have a life, and now I wish I could go back because the thought of having to face living day after day, year after year, for like 60 more years sounds very overwhelming.

depression,"Hi guys, this is my story against depression for 10+ years. I am still having my fight against it right now but I hope that I could convey some of my thoughts to help/motivate those who have also walk down the same path as me. I have suffered depression since my start of my teenage years due to a loss of one of my family member. Back then, I wasn't able to get over the grief and I'm constantly at my low. It didn't help that during those times, mental illness were constantly misinformed and wasn't known as compared to now in my country. In fact, before I had my depression, I always thought that mental illness is for people who are crazy and weird. Only when I experienced it, do I understand how and what mental illness exactly are. Things spiralled down and keep getting bad to worse till I become a shut in for a few years. 

Honestly, even with depression, that doesn't void me from feeling the responsibility in society too. The norms of the society and my personal responsibility as a son, an elder sibling leads to me wishing that I never should had fallen down so hard. Even till now, I wish to become back to before I fell into depression. I wish I could have been back to how I used to be, where I was actually doing well in academic and socially. 

During my depression, I was always having bad insomnia. Days when I couldn't sleep at all till exhaustion and then when I doze off, I would always woke up suddenly during the middle of my routine and couldn't fall back to sleep again. Tried all the internet methods but nothing help. Till now, this has always been my number one issue to having a fixed life. I have also cut off my friends and had numerous suicide attempts and was once admitted to a mental hospital due to it. Life wasn't easy and honestly I have always wanted to end my life because I felt like a huge burden to people around me. I always ask myself, ""Why live when all you see are darkness around you and you know that it will be the same tomorrow?""

However, things did start to change slowly for me. I took my first step out when I was encouraged by my parents who wanted to bring me out. I didn't know why or how I pick up the courage to go out that day but I'm glad I did. I have also seek help for close to 8-9 years and through time I have changed different psychologist/psychiatrist and I'm glad that my current ones are usually helpful and supportive of me. I'm also taking my meds regularly nowadays after years of swapping medicine to find the right one for me. Things are getting better but I can't deny that I do have my bad days too. 

So for all the people around here, I want to tell you that though things might be tough for you now, it will get better one day. Depression is a journey with it's highs and lows and it's never easy to fight against it. Even if you ask me, I would never tell you if you can recover depression because I personally believe you can't recover from it. However, that doesn't mean that you can't overcome the challenges that comes in it. Things might be hard but you will never be alone. Your family, friends or if you seek help, your doctor will be by your side. Even if none of them stand by you, remember that this forum and me will always be there to support if you need a listening ear. You are special and there is only one you in this world, so don't give up and keep fighting!

depression,"Title pretty much sums it up. I’m so ugly, pair that with depression, it instantly repels people away. Scroll down for TL;DR.

When I was a kid, I used to not care about what others thought of me or how they see me. I wear what I want, I do what I want. Now, I’m growing up and on my way to adulthood, I become more aware and so insecure about what I look like. 

No matter how much positivity I put to myself, I know what I look like and it’s not good. I‘m just so ugly. I tried to ignore society’s standards but I couldn’t. I don’t have friends in real life because they prefer to be friends with someone who’s prettier. Even though our personalities are the same or even if they’re a bad, it’s obvious that they will still prefer the company of the good-looking person. Pretty privilege really exist.

""Beauty is in the eyes of the beholder"", or so they say and it’s true. In school, I got bullied because of what I look like, that ugly skinny Asian girl who’s trying so hard to prove she‘s not depressed. I read so many advices on how to avoid depression; I had this positive outlook in life, I was sharing my interests to my classmates, cheering them on during class presentations, I even joined their group during break and lunch time, even after classes. I cracked jokes, bought them food, listened and understood their problems, helped them on our lectures and homeworks but still, at the end of the day, my presence wasn’t needed because of what I look like. I knew I wasn’t meant to have friends. I knew I wasn’t enough.

It’s called ""Love at first sight"" for a reason. No matter how good your personality is or how much skills you have, as long as you’re ugly, nobody will want you. My ex-boyfriend told me he was with me out of pity, he knew I was depressed and insecure. He never loved me. I tried to be happy and satisfy him during our relationship but for years, he just took advantage of how low I think of myself. I know my body looks like shit no matter how much he patronized me being a ""busty petite"". My depression and insecurities fueled his ego. I knew I wasn’t meant to be loved. I knew I wasn’t enough.

My family, particularly my parents, are one of the root causes of my depression. They’d always comment negative on everything I do. My mother told me fixing my hair and putting on make-up won’t make me pretty. My father mocked my interests and favorites. My relatives would tease my eating habits and my figure, saying it’s weird and would often say sexual jokes about it that makes me so uncomfortable. No matter how much academic achievements I have or extra curricular activities I do in school, they don’t care. I know I’m always not enough.

Fucked up mind, fucked up emotions, fucked up face, fucked up body. I’m just damaged goods. Even if I get rid of my depression and somehow get better, nobody will choose to be with me. No matter how much I force myself to people, they won’t care. I know there’s always someone better than me, I know that. People around me will always take advantage of my kindness because of what I look like and how I feel.

**TL;DR** \- Ugliness and depression, what a bad combination. Attend therapy to get rid of depression, I’m still ugly. Get surgery to boost my confidence, I’m still depressed. Do both? Maybe someday if I get money for it and don’t kill myself yet, but does that guarantee that I’ll be 100% happy? No.

I know I’m gonna be alone for the rest of my life or until I die.

I've been struggling for years now and I keep getting worse and my hope for a happy life is slowly disappearing.
When I first saw a therapist he told me I had anxiety disorder, and I saw him a couple more time but I don't think it helped, and his advice was more like ""try to talk to people more"", ""go outside everyday"", ""try to exercise a bit!"" (at that time I was doing 6 hours of sports per week). And it was expensive so then I stopped going. Then years later I saw another therapist but I felt uncomfortable with her and I felt like I was feeling worse every time I went to saw her. After that, I decided to go see a psychiatrist. Basically she told me : ""You have a job, you went to college, you're in a relationship, I don't know what you're doing here, I don't know what I can do for you, I don't understand why you feel bad."" (she sure was glad to bill me 100$ for that 50-minute session though. So that didn't bring me anything either.
Lastly, a couple months ago I asked my insurance company for a session with a therapist and they scheduled a phone session for me. However the therapist didn't call at the scheduled time but called me randomly at 10:30pm from a private number. I asked him if he could call again at the scheduled time cause I was in bed. He got mad, yelled at me, hung up and never called again.

I’m still very nervous about this, but at this point I really owe it to myself but, even more so, my partner to try this. Just try and see if it will help my mood. If not we’ll figure it out from there.  
  
I took my first pill Monday noonish and a few hours later I felt like downright sewage dump. It’s hard to even explain. I was physically nauseous but I could not throw up. I was hungry but could not eat one bit. Nothing in my brain aligned. I think we watched a movie but I don’t remember which. I think I had dinner at some point. I went to bed crying, feeling absolutely miserable and with no words to even try to say why.   
It was scary!   
The next two days have been rough but better. I’ve had a splitting headache and still my appetite eludes me and I get this wave of nausea. I’m usually not the type that likes to nap, but yesterday I slept for 2 hrs in the afternoon. I still went to bed at 10pm tired. I didn’t sleep solid through the night but a good part of it.   

Today things have felt a little better. I feel proper hungry despite the struggle to eat (I’ve already lost a few kilos - not good!) and my head is not bursting like the whole bloody universe is expanding in there.   
What’s more; my brain is sort of back. I’m able to write these words. They come easy to me and feel good! I’m an aspiring author and being able to put words down is just such a huge relief! I’m still tired as shit. It just hit me about an hour ago (I’m thinking the pills might be the tricker so have to see if I can shift the time I take them), but instead of curling up on the bed as I really wanted to (and am now btw) I went for a short walk.   
To be proud of a 15 min walk seems so arbitrary and stupid, but I did it! I also had a piece of toast earlier and some scrambled eggs and I’m actually feeling hungry again now.   
  

I don’t know what the point of this post is, if there really was a point, or if anyone has even made it this far in my ramble. But for the first time in a very long time I actually feel kinda hopeful. There’s this strange open feeling in my head that I’m pretty sure is just the baseline _happiness_ instead of misery. It’s wild!  
There might actually be light at the end of the tunnel and it might just be that I, just like _you_ , deserves that happiness too!   

If you read this far, I hope you are doing okay. I hope you know that you deserve to be happy and loved. I hope you know that you are beautiful, that you are not alone and there’s light out there for you too.

depression,"All I have is my family and sister.  Although I love them very much I wish I had  some friends.. the most maddening thing is took me until 27 there's nothing wrong with me or how I am Its just I don't gel with others when I feel like only surface level no deeper connection. I just can't care enough, you don't care about me really and I cant  do this small talk shit. I do know its needed for certain situations to lead to those deeper connections just never happens for me.

That's the most maddening thing, everyone has their own friends and even if by some miracle you do connect, you''ll never be their go to friend to invite... you'll most likely have to invite them.  I pushed someone away because of this who I dated, I'm the one who asked her to be friends because I needed friends or a relationship so rejection is easy to take especially if we had good time still.  But I said something how I wanted to be more then instagram friends and how I would like to meet her friends (she got scared i think.... All i said is fine... lets not be friends but I went back on it... because I've always wanted a friend... I never felt so pathetic in my life, thats what isolation and longing for belonging will do to you. I thought she was would understand being new herself to the country... but I'm dumb no one truely understands depression. I was actually starting to get a little bit better at twenty five but Idk with this pandemic.

I missed out on the college experience, but I didn't go to college where there were dorms anything it was commuter college. Never made any friends there. Now I'm depressed little boy in 6'1 200lbs+ body.  Bullied on my weight, had a lot body image issues since as young as grade 4 remember I would tell my self I'm not going to eat anything. from 20-23 I would just go to school and come back home. 24 dropped out depressed got help at 25 and Now im still fighting at 27.   I've had depression since 20, I never realized what this lonely feeling was... I'm still trying to understand and hopefully I can find something. Getting lost in media and video games was solace from this pain I was feeling,I was also feeling sucidal thoughts and loneliness at one point so bad my dog  (funny how they know sometimes) i was literally shaking he came up and curled right up by me. I rememeber walking my dog thinking if this doesnt change by the time I'm thirty I'm offing my self. I was 24 at the time.

Not worried about school... although I don't like how education is taught its all about the money not even learning properly... I loved learning

I'm good looking according to people(don't think this is requirement for friends but i guess it helps... and kind so why am I alone, why am I  not worthy of friendship?

Think lot of depression  stems for these expectations and not knowing how to accept faillure but from what we are force fed as a child .. I'm rambling and its 5:00 am cant get all my thoughts out or coherently out.

I'll tell you one last thing to whoever reads this....I hate on all these media platforms that people say they care on linked in, instagram or whatever but they don't  they only want to make themselves feel good or look good to others. We like a good success story but don't want to hear the dark battle that unfolds before victory. Keep fighting and I will too... I'm working at this shit job... its not too hard and it pays ok for where I am at now I cant wait to go back to school...Also I can't to travel to Ireland... thats where the girl was from she got me interested in it...I'm not waiting for anyone anymore I'm going to solo travel, and its one of the things that gives me joy along with trying to learn about people and the connections.. that are out there.

I had an amazing relationship, with a man that is so perfect for me and things are just falling apart and I'm guessing it's ending. We love each other and can't be together and it's literally killing me.

I feel lonely. I don't really have anyone to talk to. 

On top of that, I loaned my mother 2k, which I know I shouldn't have and now I am in the hole. Woke up to 2 NSF fees yesterday. One in each account. I can't even buy groceries or pay bills right now. And I knew this shit was going to happen, but UGH.

I felt like I was starting to do alright. I quit drinking on new years. Haven't had a single drink. I am currently down 13 pounds since then, which is amazing and I am so happy for it since weight has been a large factor in my depression..

depression,"I don’t know when it started but I think there is something wrong and I don’t know how to get out of whatever is happening. I think the last time I felt energy and joy was just during a two week period in December and that is it. I was up for two days straight and felt so much energy the entire time and I was a little concerned too because I felt abnormal. I was really productive though and exited to start University again etc. Before that period I don’t think I felt anything but perpetually sad. I just moved back in with my parents and I can’t talk to them about anything. I can’t eat more than one meal a day without feeling incredibly nauseous, I just calculated my calorie intake after realising I missed my period again and it is below 600 everyday. I am so paranoid, I have nightmares so much and I can’t sleep much anyway. I have no energy so I am in bed most of the day and I don’t talk to anyone. My relationship with my mother is really bad, she never bonded with me emotionally and I don’t think she is capable of that anyway. I have just been trying to come to terms with the fact that she doesn’t care for me at all this past year. My mother does not believe in therapy and she had a traumatic childhood, so it is extremely stressful at home. 

I really can’t eat or sleep, I don’t have the energy  and I can’t stomach anything anyway. I don’t know what to do because I think my body is not doing well but I really can’t stand having to try over and over again. 

The thoughts won’t stop though and my OCD is really bad again. I can’t do so many things and I have the most absurd rationale but to an extent I believe it. 
I don’t know what to do because I don’t have enough money to move out and I don’t have anyone I can talk to about this (which makes it even harder to resist the thoughts I think) I just feel awful and dislike myself immensely and I honestly think I feel like I am wasting space and resources. I think I read something recently that confident children grow up with parents that support them emotionally and don’t judge them or their interests but rather encourage them. I don’t think i ever had that so maybe that is why I have always been so incredibly insecure. 



I don’t think anyone will read this but a therapist I used to have said it would be helpful to write out my thoughts and feelings so

I have never hit my mother, I have never said I hate her or “I wish you weren’t my mother” 
I know I am not passive aggressive or angry, am not loud. I have exhibited some narcissistic traits especially as a teenager, but never to the extent she does. I have called her manipulative (big mistake that one) and I have called her a bitch (just to preface)

I was looking for my bed sheets in a hallway cupboard as quietly as I possibly can because my mother has CPTSD and she basically just drifts in and out of sleep every night but is incredibly angry with absolutely everything so if she hears the slightest noise she will wake up everyone else in the house with her screaming. 
Basically the only time I ever hear my mother is when she is screaming about something. Stressful is an understatement. 

I open the cupboard door as softly as possible, then my mothers voice “who was that” grab my sheets and close it as quietly as I can. I hear the door lock click open (which is basically a signal that my mother is about to start running for whoever she thinks the perpetrator is) and I back away into the door to my youngest sisters room (which I share with her) my mother starts screaming and shakes me like she usually does but she pushes me backward into the room so I land on the vacuum cleaner. She walked away as soon as she did and no one in my family has spoken about it since. 

I know my mother emotionally abuses me but is slapping sometimes and things like this considered traumatic? 
She has strangled me before (my father had to pry her off me and I was spanked all the time as a child but I feel like I am being a victim because my parents were belted and others suffer much more than things like this, maybe I am overreacting idk, but I have such bad paranoia I can hardly sleep at night because I am worried my mother is going to snap and hurt me. I have nightmares where she stabs me to death and she just hates me so much. She has so much anger and resentment and I have no idea why she doesn’t like me, I have no idea what I don’t give her that my sisters must give her. I am so tired of crying over how my mother will never love me because I feel like I am being overly dramatic but it feels like suddenly this empty void, I just feel so sad when I think of her and when she sees me I see nothing but contempt in her eyes.","I don’t know what is going on, is this considered abuse?

depression,"When I was 19, they felt so normal to me. It didn't really freak me out that I was thinking about killing myself multiple times every day. It felt like the only thing that was keeping me from doing it was the thought of making my parents bury their son. Around 23 or 24, I realized that I hadn't really had any thoughts like that in a while. And for the last 5 years, suicidal thoughts were something that freaked me out. It's good that they freaked me out. Life was so good that those thoughts had become jarring - like putting my hand on a hot stove, and recoiling before the burn. 

For the last 6 months, I've left my hand on the burner. I can't stop. I thought it would pass, but it isn't. Therapy doesn't help, we can hardly understand each other through the phone anyway. At the beginning of covid, I was laid off from the most exciting job of my life after being there for 1 month. I'm still unemployed. I'm paying thousands to take online classes, and I'm in group projects with teenagers who don't give a shit about their grades, while I'm trying to finally start getting my life together and get into better schools. I'm getting fat. Sleeping 12 hours a day. I get angrier every day; at myself, at everyone else. I don't like who I'm becoming. I'm finding myself needing to vent frustrations more than ever, but I have no one. The ex took the dog. At least she's letting me keep the cat, for now. Maybe if I killed myself, she'd see how fucked up I am and stop worrying about what could have been. And if it's not conceited, vain personal shit like the above, I'm thinking about how little hope I have for humanity in general. I'm so pissed off at where we've gotten ourselves. I'm mad that I don't know what information is real and what isn't. I'm mad that no one seems to care that hating your neighbour has become normal, even celebrated. No matter where you are, everyone is at each other's throats. I don't want to think about it anymore, but it's everywhere. And I don't think it's ever going to improve.

depression,"So one day in 4th grade I realized that I was going to die. There was no avoiding it. It’s happening to everyone eventually. On the thought of existentialism, I nagged my parents on what happened when you died, and what the meaning of life was, but I never really got an answer that I liked. I asked them every day, hoping for an answer other than “life is what you make of it.” Or “to accomplish your dreams.”
Eventually I accepted that I would probably never get a good answer, and my energy completely tanked for a good year or two after realizing this. I just felt so apathetic about everything since it’s all just gonna be in the ground some day, right? No point in being happy or going out, so I stopped hanging out with friends, and lost a few good ones after saying some hurtful stuff. I just lacked the motivation to even think about doing anything productive, and felt like everyone who was being happy were just blissfully delusional for their own sake. I realized I was probably depressed once I found I was thinking about dying on a day to day basis.
But once I moved to 7th grade and puberty hit and my hormones skyrocketed, I felt like a fucking god. I still thought about dying and all that, but it just seemed so distant to me that I didn’t care anymore. I socialized, found new hobbies, made some new friends, all this stuff that I lacked the enthusiasm to do suddenly became so much easier. Things were good from then on.
However, I feel like the same apathy is slowly coming back. I’m losing my motivation to do what I used to love, with the excuse that I’ll either just do it later or I just never do it. I picked up art shortly after 7th grade and have been working really hard to get better ever since then, but I can’t even get myself to do that anymore. The two things I liked to do, art and music, are no longer fun for me. I don’t want to fall back into the apathetic slump I was in before.

And well the beginning of 2020 wasn't any better. Full disclaimer: I fought depression years ago and eventually went to therapy. Best thing I've done. But I found out that during times like this it can still creep back on you. 

So I got into this rut that many of you know. Just sleeping and eating. I spent most of last 30 days in bed sleeping. Not being able to bring myself to do anything. Sometimes I'd play a video game or watch a movie but that wouldn't keep my attention for too long. 

Anyway today I wake at noon. Go to toilet with my phone. I receive an email from Steam and it does this whistling sound. And please don't think I'm crazy but it reminded me of Monthy Python and Always Look on the Bright Side of Life lol. So I immediately started whistling and singing. Then played the song on my TV and had so much fun haha. 

I know this is just my case but already been trough therapy and I needed this reminder that my life isn't a that grey. The pandemic sucks. But I've been working my ass off, got some nice overtime and bonuses which will definitely help in the future.

depression,"I just want to let this out.   


I'm relapsing because of my grandma's death. It actually happened last September, but I was only able to process it today because I kept it in for so long so I can function properly Huge mistake! But to be fair, if I get depressed--I can't do anything, so I just pretended I wasn't depressed. 

The reason I did that was because I needed to go to university and do my part-time job &lt;which I eventually quit&gt; and I felt immensely guilty not to go to university &lt;asian parents, expensive tuition fees&gt; even tho I knew I can't so I just forced myself to believing I was okay.

To be honest, I didn't even realize until now how much I pushed myself to be okay when I obviously wasn't just so I can function. I guess because I was scared to be depressed again (Last major depressive phase I had was 2 years ago.) I also didn't want to be perceived as a quitter but then I realize, it's okay to fucking take a break.   


Anyway, fast forward to the present. I have a significant other, who I love very much. I tried my best not to let the depression get to me, because I knew how destructive I can get when I was depressed, but actually (and ironically), it was may more destructive to fight it instead of letting go of control and accepting that there it is, My Depression. Now, it affected our relationship.   


There were numerous times I let my overthinking get to me--hence, the controlling, the jealousy, the emotional turbulence. It hasn't gotten to the point that it's really bad--but I still feel immensely guilty.  I keep letting my overthinking get to me and I feel so guilty.   


Me and my partner are taking some space away from each other, because we're both not feeling okay. I miss him so much. Today I panicked and kept messaging him (five times) but it's only because I let my overthinking get to me again.   


I've been doing some self-therapy, and some mindfulness practices and journalling--trying to get myself interested in things too; but I think I need to go back to the therapist and get some medication going because no matter how hard I try my brain isn't producing the happy, motivational chemicals it needs to produce. I also told my parents (We're not a very emotionally open family so I struggled to tell that I was depressed again) and they were accepting. Not the most emotionally supportive response, but I'm just glad they accepted it.   


Anyway, I just want to be okay again. For myself. For my boyfriend. For my friends. I love living when I'm not depressed, but I want to love living while I'm struggling to be better too.

depression,My husband and I have been together for 8 years and married for 1 year. I love him to bits but I really would like to understand things from his point of view better but he has a lot of difficulties talking about it or even thinking about it. I'm a very emotional person who sometimes has there down days but he has depression and suppresses his emotions. I always knew he had depression and thought it would be something I could deal with but I don't think I ever fully understood it. Since we have got married and covid it's become more of an issue. He tells me he can't handle intense emotions. So even if we are just sitting in a room talking and laughing that can be a bit too much for him and he will need to leave the room and have maybe an hour of alone time. I'm cool with us not spending every moment with each other that's normal but I find it concerning that even positive emotions are an issue for him and something he would rather avoid. I was wondering if anyone understands this or had similar experiences?

My parents got several calls from my school telling them I havent done any work, but since you cant fail 9th grade here, I didn’t really give any care. Boom, a year goes by. Time just keeps going faster and faster now, the once 9 month old sister is turning 2 this year and thats what hurts me the most; I love babies and seeing my sister grow up so fast without me just brings me so low.

depression,"Hello, first time here. I am so tired, physically and mentally. Trying to stay alive and functional has become a full time job. It has become physically tiring to push negative, obsessive thoughts away and I constantly feel like I want to collapse on the floor and never get up again. 

I have been depressive and anxious my whole life. But I feel like growing up in a country (Italy) where being depressed was never really an option (both my dad and other members of my family are functional depressive people but it was never even discussed) and was seen as weakness made me react to it in a ""strong"" way, mainly turning all of my emotions into anger. I am angry at all times, and often joke about the fact that I am powered by anger (and as you can imagine it's not an attractive  feature in a woman).

I moved to the uk in my 20s to hide away from my family so that I could be sad and let go. I was severely anorexic when I left my country, but leaving did help. I gained weight and managed to explore my feelings and come to terms with them. But mainly what helped was living in a small Welsh town where finding purpose was easy, where all I had to do is doing my masters and work in my spare time, which kept me busy and channelled my anger into being physically tired at all times from the active job.

 Things started to go wrong with the pandemic and with a new job in a bigger city. I moved to the capital and joined the ""great"" corporate world. I hate every single aspect of it. But there is nothing else that could give me the security I need to calm my anxiety about not having a steady income. This is an office job and I am a trainee in a team of men, needless to say I have zero human interaction the whole day working from home.

These days all I can think of is that I want to fall on the floor, I keep thinking if I do I can just stay there forever. My anxiety is through the roof because of brexit and bureaucracy and the fear of being deported or something. I can't stop crying but I manage to hide from my boyfriend whom I live with, a part from when I have literal anger outbursts where I have to lock my self in a room and punch bouldering matts (which I am very thankful for cause they help with instant relief). 

I use jokes quite a lot to try and ask for help from my friend and my boyfriend. The problem with having a strong personality is that people will just gloss over everything and I can't express how I feel. And every time I try to say how I feel, it sounds farfetched or like I am using the ""I am so depressed"" phrase that people use all the times without knowing how depression feels. And I feel like I can't ask for validation. I hate that word but that's the only thing I can think of. 

This morning I can't stop crying, and I asked my boyfriend to leave me alone and not come to the room I am ""working"" in. I just really want to disappear completely. But I feel like he just thinks it's that I am a bit of a moody person. This angers me even more. 

He has a history of depression and he mentioned once he had a suicide attempt when he was younger and was on medication. He never really talks about it. But any time I mention I need help, he kind of glosses over it in a patronising way. This angers me towards him. He is a very gentle person, and we have very good relationship, I wouldn't change him for anything, but somehow he only sees the things he wants to see. I mentioned medication once and he kind hinted at the fact that I don't need it and that the pandemic is hard on everyone. 

My best friend in the meantime has disappeared taken by her new job and ever present boyfriend, who has become the centre of her life. She is one of these women who use to complain about women disappearing when they get a boyfriend, yet she did exactly the same thing. She only came to visit me a few times by herself, only cause she had an argument with him. This has made me quite disenchanted with our friendship and I can't really be bothered to even propose to see her anymore. 

I keep thinking I am just going to fade away. I don't have an outlet for my feelings and living with my boyfriend has brought me back to hiding how I feel like I used to do when I lived with my parents in Italy. I have been having serious body dysmorphia again, gender dysphoria (which I have had my whole life), and started to count calories. I lost every interest I ever had, and the only ""hobby"" I have is watch videos of people building campervans...hoping I can save some money to do the same and disappear.

My S/o and child made plans to stream a movie while I was working. My child gave 0 cares that I went to bed directly from getting off work but my S/o did. I did not mean to upset my S/o, I didn't know watching it even mattered that much to S/o. 

I go to the bedroom an I am  just staring at the wall and crying because I just feel like I have nothing inside me but sadness. I struggled to not sit at my WFH desk and just cry. It took a lot of energy not to cry at work.   I am not interested in anything anymore, I just sit around waiting for my life to be over because I realize I will never matter to anyone. 

My S/o came to bed but then everything  turned into an argument. I wasn't trying to make S/o mad an I begged S/o just tell me ""what you want to hear"" because I didn't think I was doing anything wrong by going to bed early to stare at the wall. However... I apparently  did because S/o starts going off about how they can leave, they can just go if they are bothering me that much... I told S/o they weren't I was just sitting there before they entered the room. I don't know if he doesn't believe  me or if he just is that annoyed by my presence. I don't know what I am doing wrong. 

Everyone has made it extremely  clear they do not want to see me upset; but then apparently  I am the piece of shit because I went to another room to be sad, to cry alone because when I cry when people are awake, I am also a piece of shit.

depression,"Am I just an idiot, or can years and years of depression change a person at their core. 

I’ve heard the expression, “depression leaves a person a shell of who they once were.” I believe my changes are more intense than this. I am unrecognizable (not physically, but my personality). I was incredibly intelligent, active, and humorous. Now, I can barely socialize. I maintained a 4.0 throughout high school and for most of college until this last year- failing multiple courses. I struggle to recall simple nouns like “lense” or “Parmesan cheese.” I forget things constantly. I set down my phone right next to me, lose track of it, and relocate it in the same spot 10 minutes later. It’s scary, because I’m not scatterbrained. I feel like I could receive an early-onset dementia diagnosis ~AT 21 YEARS OLD. 

I shouldn’t be decomposing mentally. I take vitamins, exercise, eat relatively healthy, and am maintaining my goal weight. For my brain, I read, attend school, and work in a stimulating environment. I try to avoid excessive media consumption, because I feel it worsens my symptoms. The fact that none of these healthy habits are helping is discouraging. This only fuels my depression, and encourages thoughts of ending my existence; before I become completely inept. 


Despite these major problems, I have a good life (quality relationships with friends, family, and my boyfriend- remaining in school- working a job that is bearable and a stepping stone). I am achieving all the goals I hoped to, but clearly struggling with my mental health and cognitive abilities.

depression,"I had therapy Thursday.  My therapist  is sending worksheets for CBT and DBT things. I do not have a good grasp of them, and she did not bring them up during a session she emails them post; so I don't get a chance to ask. Yet this is only session 3 so there could be a method to this.

 My therapist asked if the medication was helping. I asked her how would I know? She looked confused;  I am still confused because she did not answer my question. 

She then asked about my child and spouse. Which every therapist I've had to see as an adult does this. 

WHY? What is the reason for the therapist bringing up my child and spouse? 

So, how will I know when the medication is helping? From others experience when did you know you were moving away from depression or at least in a better direction?",What Is Better an Other Things I Do Not Understand in Therapy,rratednerd

Is this normal? 

I took adderall the other day for work and suddenly I feel happier and human again. (Although probably not for the right reasons)

depression,"I've never really seen the significance in building good habits with schooling. I've always been able to scrape by with low-mid 90s without ever putting in an ounce of effort. And before the rise of this worldwide dumpster fire, I probably would have enjoyed this for as long as until the onset of the reality-fuck that is university.

Now these past couple of months/year since the abominable I've sort of fizzled off to the point of no return. I got really shitty grades for the second half of gr 11, I'm talking 60s-70s. And although I managed a new rhythm with the quasi-in person learning model presented to us in autumn, everything has gone to royal shit again and I'm starting to lose it. I was scoring very high marks in chemistry and math, but once we transitioned back to the online model it all fell apart. I've probably failed both courses. They officially ended a week ago, and since a good portion of the course was online, I'd be lucky to get a passing grade now.

Not going to lie, I don't know if this belongs here but I'm sort of reaching an all time low. Knowing that I've nearly - if not completely - failed these two courses is causing me to seriously doubt my prospects. Given that I didn't apply to any universities due to anxiety and a failing to plan for the long-term, I don't know what I'm going to be doing for the next year or so. If I did fail these two previous courses, (obviously haven't checked and have been side stepping any worrisome emails to my apparent demise), I won't have enough credits to graduate. It's not like I wasn't given any chances to catch up too, I went through a few motivation spells managing 8+ hours a day of studying and I'd been confident because of this, but no matter what I couldn't maintain consistency and so now I just feel like I'm done.

There was hope for a while. I don't really pull motivation from long term goals, I don't do the visualization stuff. What's worked for me is focusing on people I care about and this usually manifests itself in developing relationships. Interaction with people really helps, but ever since a recent breakup with a very good friend I haven't been able to pull myself together. I've recently started self harming and drinking a lot, and I keep trying to kick the habit but I keep ruminating over these failures and worrying about the future without doing anything to solve any of my issues.

I've thrown away the razor blades, not so sure about dropping the alcohol yet, though. I've sort of given up, but not really. Guess I'm as indecisive as ever. Constantly making journal entries, taking notes on self improvement videos, reading self help books, making fucking spider diagrams on my whiteboard diagnosing my low self esteem. I know what my problems are and I have a rough idea on how to solve them but my will is just so scattered and unreliable that I can't stick to anything. I'm a weak-willed, self-absorbed hedonistic doomer. Everything is just so much harder online and with the restrictions. I can't rely on my smarts to scrape by when I have no will to even pick up the pencil for days and weeks at a time. I can't bring myself to reach out to the right people, and I know it's destroying me, but alas I guess this is my doom. Anxiety-ridden and regret-laden.

depression,"Hello, obviously this is a throwaway account because i intend to post this and never look back. I just need to throw it out there for somebody to read. 

Why? I Don’t know to be quite honest. The fact that im writing this feels childish but my impulses got the better of me so here goes. 

My father founded a chain of gasstations that operate all over europe. That’s all im willing to disclose though, you’ll just have to take my word for it. If not thats fine too. The point i’m making is, i come from a family with a lot of money. 

And i’m utterly miserable. 

Nothing can give me a glimpse happiness. Absolutely nothing. Not love, not travel, not expensive clothes, cars, jewelry. Nothing. I don’t think i’ve cried since i was 13 years old. I just feel numb, nothingness. Have for a long time now. 

When it was time for me to go to high school my father suggested i go to Collège Stanislas de Paris. A catholic boarding school in France. 2000 miles from home. He convinced me by telling me all these stories on how amazing France was and how it was going to be an adventure for me. Because he was my dad I believed him i accepted and got sent out the following month.  

A few months after arriving in France my mother called me telling me my dad was selling the company and retiring from business all together. At first i was really exited, one of the main reasons of me leaving home was because my dad told me they simply didn’t have enough time to take care of me. My mom was also a very prominent figure in the business so she was never really there to be a mom. She never really wanted to. I think having a kid was more my dad’s thing. Anyway, i asked my mom if my dad’s retirement meant i could come home. She told me in a passive aggressive tone that i had to finish what i started so reluctantly i caved and agreed to stay. 

When summer rolled around my father visited me for a day and told me he and my mom were gonna take a trip. Basically a 4 month vacation to asia to relax and enjoy some “well deserved rest” that summer. After he left the realization kicked in. My parents pawned me off just so they could do whatever they wanted while i got tucked away in a summer school. Keep in mind i was 14 at the time so I felt betrayed and sold off. Especially because i wasn’t even allowed to go back home. I never cared about going to exotic places or expensive resorts. I just wanted to spend time with my parents like a normal family. They cut me out of everything. 

I started acting out as a cry for attention from my parents. I threw my computer through a glass door at school, i took a door out of the hinges so that when a teacher opened the door it would immediately drop on their heads, i even lit my room on fire. Yet, they never listened, i don’t even think they ever really cared. I never got scolded or in trouble so i think that proves it. I’ve always resented them for abandoning me. 

I graduated two years ago and I decided to stay in Paris. Believe me, not because i like it. Frankly, i hate this place. I hate the people, i hate the city, i even hate the pigeons sitting on my balcony right now. But i cant go back home, i don’t even feel like a native of my birth country anymore. I belong nowhere. 

I hate being me. One thing i hear all the time after meeting people and them finding out who my parents are is “you must live a pretty awesome life huh?” 

No. No i don’t. It fucking sucks. Nobody gives a fuck about me. I never let any girl get close to me in fear of them taking advantage of me. I have literally 0 friends. If i die right now i wouldn’t even know how long it would take for somebody to find me. Could be weeks. 

I’ve been isolating myself for the past 25 days. 
Im all alone now, and i have no idea what the fuck im going to do with the rest of my life. The fear of living like this for the rest if my life far outweighs the fear of death. 

I’ll just leave it at that.

depression,"I'm suicidal. I have anxiety &amp; I've been struggling on &amp; off with depression for the better part of a decade.

But I've been trying, I want to be better, but I don't even know where to start, I've tried journaling; meditation; talking it out, but that last one is where the problem mostly is.

I tried talking it out with my best friend of 10 years: we're no longer best friends.

I tried talking about it with my boyfriend: he just broke up with me.

I want to be better for my family, my brothers &amp; my parents, my dad also has depression &amp; has told me that he's had suicidal thoughts; I've heard about things like the domino effect, what if I really do kill myself &amp; he does the same? I think I'd die all over again.

I want to be better for myself, I hate feeling worthless all the time, but it's hard when I feel like I am, &amp; that no one really loves me.

I know... I'm pretty sure my family does, but as much as it pains me to admit, it doesn't do much for me: I feel like it's more of an obligation than anything else.

It's hard to feel loved when everyone without any obligation to stick around who's ever claimed to love me has left.

I guess I'm just feeling extra blue since my boyfriend just broke up with me- I mean ""just"" quite literally: it was today, he was my first love, &amp; my first boyfriend, &amp; I really thought we'd work: we met each other's families, we talked about everything- good &amp; bad, I feel so stupid, because we'd only been dating for several months, but we spent it almost entirely together until around the end.

I was coming out of a really rough friend break-up when we first got together, I guess that's why I got attached so quickly.

I used to think that he loved me, &amp; wanted to stay with me: it didn't fix all my problems, but it gave me the energy to try &amp; do it myself.

Now that's gone, &amp; I just need SOMETHING, cause I still can't make myself stop crying.

I'm only in my twenties, I'm too young to be feeling like this, it's not that I don't feel like there's anything left, I know there's a lot left to do, or see, or feel- but I'm losing the will to experience it; I'm losing the will to keep living, I don't want to die though, I just want to stop being hurt by the people I trust the most.

depression,"Sorry this is sort of a thought dump of issues I have and see.    
life is a humiliating thing.  i don't know,  i don't feel good with my words right now.  but it's like life is one series of difficult humiliations after another.  i tried to speak in a really honest way to my SO yesterday but it just came out gobbledygook, and he didn't get what i was saying i feel.  Just a blank expression and there was no point in keeping trying cause it just wasn't coming through or something, so I went to bed then.  And now I have this embarrassing conversation I know I had, which before i was not talking about it cause I didn't want to be put in this vulnerable place and I think I had been right all along to not talk.  And that is where I always find myself, that it would have been better to say nothing, to be quiet, when talking to really anyone.    
I think that when you are in the place where you are struggling things compound and get that much harder to get back to what normal life is supposed to be like.  For instance you are less likely to know how to talk to people, so you shut yourself away so as not to cause a problem, which then you become even less good at connecting as time goes on.  Or like meeting goals, when you're depressed or something is going on it gets harder to meet the goals that equate to success at what you are trying to do which then next time around you are farther down, still trying to keep going and it is just even harder.  So depression type problems have a terrible spiral issue that makes it so much harder to get back out of it.   
this year for me has been a series of panic attacks, i have been caregiver to my dad, and my mother now visits, and he has health problems, and it's been half a year like this.  except my childhood was really bad.  i get terrible panic attacks when i see my mother still.  i have to deal with what could be emergencies with my dad all the time.

I've been depressed since I was maybe 13..I grew up in a toxic home with a manipulative mother who constantly gaslit me and made me feel like a burden on her life. She denied me having depression and would tell me to get over it, or that I was too young to feel that way, or that it was a phase. Because of her I never got the real help I needed. When I finally did get depression meds they made me feel even worse. I've been through so many emotionally and sexually abuse relationships where men used me until they were tired of me. And now I actually live in another state with the love of my life and our pet...and I feel like the only reason I choose to stay here is because of them. My boyfriend is why I wake up every day. I want to marry him and have a future...but life is still so incredibly painful. I work a shitty job and I'm barely making any money to save or spend, and I don't know how I'm supposed to plan for a future when I barely make any money. I know I could get another job but I like my coworkers and I hate starting over at a new place so much..because I'm shy and everyone usually thinks I'm a bitch because I'm quiet or they think I'm just the weird fat girl no one cares about. I hate my body so much and I've been big ever since I started having depression...I've done so much to lose weight and it's so hard to keep up with being healthy and I can't even stand to look at myself in the mirror and I don't like people taking photos of me because I feel so disgusting. I've self harmed because I feel so gross and I experience dysmorphia.

depression,"As the title says, each time I look through peoples' posts of what stopping you from killing yourself, the single most frequent reason I see is not wanting to hurt one's parents. 

I never felt attached to my family, tbh I fuckin despise them. 

Even though I was beaten occasionally, the physical abuse didn't really hurt that much, but all of my life, they made me believe that I am unworthy of love if I didn't achieve something, that my grades, achievements and devotion to God are the only things that matter, and whenever I did something 'morally' wrong they would tell me in great details how I failed them and how much of a disappointment I am.

I put 'morally' in quotes marks because it's not objectively wrong, for example when they caught me watching porn, I got beaten of course, but what sticks in my mind to this day, is how my parents looked at me with disgust and despise for watching some porn as a teenager, and they made sure to discipline me in front of my big brothers. 

Another example is when I don't go to the mosque to pray with them, the amount of disappointment and contempt they show is immeasurable, it's like I am waste of oxygen.

One frequent insult I received a lot was how much corrupt I am, and that I was bad from the time I was just an egg, I will leave it to your imagination what were the 'horrible' things I did to receive such insults.

All of these memories and emotions made me turn into the most cynical person you will ever see, and even though I am graduated from medical school, I couldn't feel a single spark of joy or sense of achievement from it, mostly because I was forced to do it even tho I didn't have any interest in medicine.

It physically pains me when I see people showing affection in public, especially between parents and children, because I feel so jealous and envious by it. And I don't think I have ever heard the words ""I love you"" from anyone, not even my mother. 

I have been thinking about suicide for more than 10 years now, and each time I think about it I wish I could see how my family would react, I want them to feel guilty, I want them to know that I am like this because of them, I want them to be consumed and shattered with guilt and agony. 

But of course if I died I won't be able to see any of this.

Even though I don't see any point in living, and I feel my life is worthless, the hope of experiencing love and acceptance one day is what makes me keep on living.","I am sick of all the people saying that ""I can't kms because I don't want to hurt my family""",KaiBuTsu91493

How can she think she can help people like that? Seriously, that's why drugs exist, to prescribe them and help people, you wouldn't go to someone who has cancer and tell them you won't let them have a surgery because it didn't exist thousands of years ago, like fuck off

She actually had a fit about it!? Sorry, crazy kale lady, the truth is the truth..

I am no longer posting my opinions on that sub and will make generic posts. How absolutely stupid it is! Why does it matter if someone does not agree with you. Why have a tantrum over kale and different countries view different animals?!

I moved from London in 2019 just before the covid chaos started as it is a very toxic city to live in for mental health. I moved to the coast to start fresh and be closer to my one and only friend. I have had ""friends"" in the past but everytime I've been in a relationship (all of which never last longer than 9 months) they all eventually go with her. I'm not bitter about it but more noticing that they weren't my friends to begin with. My one and only friend is being more adult with his life in the sense that he has a decent job, a gf and is buying a home with her which is awesome (genuinely mean that not being sarcastic).

depression,"I always knew what caused my severe depression and i never shared it with anyone so i finally built up the courage to write it down.. Im not a native english speaker so sorry in advance for any mistakes..

I was diagnosed with severe depression without psyhotic thoughts or whatever its called (code f32.2) few years ago after i finally built up the courage to tell my parents whats going on.. Then we found a therapist, she was great but i just wasnt enough persistent and i gave up with sessions after 2 months.. The thing is that i wasnt completely honest with her and i didnt even mention the thing that was, and still is bothering me after almost 13 years..
So im sure most of you know the feeling when your heart brakes in half because somebody you loved leaves you.. That happened to me but im pretty sure that after my heart got broken i went throught emotional breakdown which throughout few next several years caused my depression and anhedonia.
So long story short, my heart got broken when i was on summer vacation almost 13 years ago, and 1 year after that happened (i was alone in the apartment (i was 14 btw) for a week, i was high 0/24 for a week and i constantly thought about happened between us) i was walking to the beach and i saw her after a year, and i dont know wtf happened but when i saw her in the distance i got real hot in the head and after we said hi to each my heart felt like it will explode and something snapped inside me. I dont know how to describe it but it felt like everything around me lost the beauty of itself, if you get me. Since then nothing excites me, everything is mediocre to me..
7 years after that i got diagnosed with severe depression, but i stopped going after 2 months.. Im feeling a lot better since then but depression is still here, not as it used to be (i wasnt able to get out of bed) but its living inside of me and ill probably never get rid of it.

I'm starved for friendship and for love yet I can't even imagine a boyfriend being willing to actually listen to my problems and help me, so the most I can daydream about is just having someone to hug and cuddle in silence. I don't even care for sex, in fact if it could be avoided that would be for the best. It is not that I'm asexual, it is that I hate my body and can't imagine people being attracted to it.

Thing is that I can, I absolutely can, physically, be on my own. I will be moving forward in life. And it is terrifying to me that I will be miserable and alone the whole time. Wondering if people can tell the loneliness is not a choice. If they think I deserve it, that I'm pathetic for it. If they don't even consider that I'm lonely and in fact only see these horrible things I can't identify that make people not love me, not respect me. And I can't identify them, if I knew what made me so awful, I'd change. And I already changed so much. What else is there? How awful am I?",Are best friends just for kids?,UglyDuffelBag

depression,"I’m a high school senior that’s had a pretty rough high school experience. It’s been filled with heartbreaks, disappointment, anxiety, depression, pressure and pain. My parents are divorced and my dad is a terrible person. My mom doesn’t understand me what so ever and makes no attempt to. Having a mom that’s 60 when you’re 17 is hard. Very hard. I never talk to her about my problems because she’s of the “ depression is a choice “ camp, even though she’s a social worker with a degree in psychology.  The only thing that kept me going was wrestling which I started as a sophomore and I’ve always had the goal of being a sectional qualifier. When I was just starting junior year, I lost my best friend to suicide. I was absolutely broken. I didn’t talk to anyone, not even my close friends or my mom, I never spoke, never ate, spent most of my days staring at the wall in class. I never cried though, I’m not sure if it’s just the fact I’m so good at keeping my emotions in but I can’t cry even if I want to unless I’ve hit rock bottom. I can probably count on one hand the amount of times I’ve cried in the last 5 years. But I’ll get into recently. Half way through my junior year I got a concussion so I was out of school for months, then covid happened. Still pretty down and out all the way until October of this year. There was this girl in my choir class named tiler that I’ve always kinda liked. She was cute, funny, smart, caring, and an all around amazing person, and she texted me one night asking if she could help, and that text conversation started a 3 month relationship. I was on cloud nine honestly, I had an amazing girlfriend that brought light into my dark world, and I had wrestling because my town is small enough that we have a sense of normalcy. Then it all came crashing down. Tiler came to school crying one morning and she told me that her mom was kicking her out and she’s going to have to move away, and she doesn’t think she’ll come back. My heart sank. She hugged me and told me that she didn’t want to ruin my day but she needed to tell me. I had no words. The next day I was absolutely destroyed. I couldn’t do anything in class and I just told everyone I was tired. I stopped eating entirely and said I was cutting weight, I spent all my time in my room saying I had a headache, all lies but no one could tell.  Her phone was going to be taken for a very long time so she told me that she wouldn’t want to put me through the pain of a distance relationship with no contact, so this would be the end of the road for us. The next day she was leaving after school, and I pulled her into the band practice room during lunch. I told her “ I’ve already lost everything I’ve ever loved I can’t lose you too. “ 
And other things along those lines. She said she had to go and I said wait I have to say something else. She turned around and I said “ this is hard for me to say, and I don’t say this like ever” I took a breath and said. “ tiler, I love you.” She said “ I love you too.” With a tear in her eye then she had to leave so I stayed in the practice room, watching the only person who ever cared about me enough to understand me, and the only girl I’ve ever loved, walk away. I saw her after school before she had to go to her bus too. I hugged her tight, trying not to cry. I said I love you one last time, and held her hand as she walked away. As her fingers slipped out of my hand I just lost it. I went to wrestling practice and I was hollow. No focus, no aggression, nothing. Then my coach pulls me aside and said I’m gonna have to choose between wrestling 126 or 145 because my wrestling partner drake is taking my spot at 132, and my teammate Zach was taking 138. This is a terrible situation because this dropping 8 pounds in 2 days is terrible and I’d be completely dead for regionals, and going up to 145 is bad because they’ll have 15 pounds on me and that’s a huge deal. So I’m getting screwed out of the dream I’ve worked three years for and I lost the only girl I’ve ever loved in the span of 2 days. I switched to virtual school and just stay in bed all day. I have nothing to look forward to. I already told my coach I really don’t want to wrestle at regionals, and I told him I’m sorry I wasn’t strong enough to finish it. I cried that night in the shower. The only 2 things to get me out of this terrible place were both ripped from me suddenly. I have no idea what to do or how to cope, and it seems like it just gets worse as time goes on.",I’m losing the only 2 things I loved in this world and I’m losing all drive and hope,FivesDS

To get an idea of how i am
I'm a 23yo Venezuelan.
I have a mid tier economic background that was slowly declining since 2017 currently im unemployed. Stuck in Venezuela with a lockdown that has destroyed all the companies that arent related to the government and have made that those that are currently seeking employee are oversaturated with request. Meaning that I (seen as as someone with little work experience. Which is wrong. As i was rised in my area which is administrative and accounting) have lil to no opportunity to find a job. And the others are available are low income job in which i would spend more than gain.

For the past few months i have felt really down and out of my 'self'

Im normally pretty cheerful and calm and quiet. Introvert type of guy. But lately i feel like a huge Shadow has suppressed me and is holding me back.

Ever since 2014 i have been wanting to leave my country. But i needed first to finish my degree in accounting. I began my college career in 2015. Still haven't finished. Im missing 10 mats to finish it. Thats about 6 to 9 months. Max a year if i fail 1. Would had finish it. If it wasn't because i was laid off from my work.

My gf of 3 years and i broke up when the quarantine began. To this day i don't understand what went wrong. I kinda blame myself. For being unable to help her out of her depression. She never felt cute even tho she was. And she thought she was dragging me down with her due to her constant depressive state.


I always thought that by the time i was 23 ~ 24yo i would already be graduated. At least own something to my name. Like a car. Out of my country. With my sis and brother in US. My aunts. I dont mind if i was winning min wage. As i know how to manage myself and would find a way. Probably with a wife and a kid on the plans or on the way. 

But currently. I feel frustrated. None of my plans have been acomplish. And right now. Im even going at loss about what to do now. Slowly falling into depression.

Currently i cant go to US due to the embassy of my country (Venezuela) is closed since 2019 by wasnt attending cases since 2014 to get visas or anything. 

Trying to enter illegally is just dumb. But im stating to consider it.
Going to mexico to request asylum is hardly posible as i cant afford to spend too much time in mexico waiting for a response in the border.

depression,"So I started therapy (mostly for depression) a few months ago. Most sessions my therapist tries to figure out what circumstances contribute to my depression, but I honestly have no idea. For years I‘ve just woken up every day and felt miserable. Every time I tell her I had a bad week, she asks me why, but I really don‘t know. A while ago she asked me „It seems like most of your needs - having a home, enough to eat, friends... - are met, so what would you need to not be depressed any more?“ I mean, I have no idea. One of the main problems for me is that I cannot imagine anything that would make me happy. For example, I like to travel which I can‘t right now because of COVID, but I know that even if I could I‘d just be depressed in another country. Nothing makes much of a difference.
Now she said that before sessions, I should think about what I‘d like to talk about, but I have literally nothing going on in my life. Most days I just lie in bed and wait until I finally can go back to sleep. There‘s nothing to tell.
I mean I do have a few problems, relationships that are not the way I‘d like them to be etc, and of course that makes me sad, but for me, there‘s a huge difference between feeling sad and being depressed. I have no idea what outside factors contribute to my depression. Well, I actually think I know why I became depressed, but that was many years ago, my life situation changed a lot since then but I am still depressed.

I feel like my life is okay but my brain is fucked up.

depression,"Hi everyone, sorry for any writing mistakes, I’m not english. I just need a break. From everything. Really. This past months have been awful. In november it was the first time in my life when I realized the whole world is going in one direction, and I’m really struggling to follow it. I’m almost 18 (bd in three months) and I have never felt more sad in my life. Maybe it’s not even depression, sorry for that, I can’t even think how really depessed people feel, but I’m really down. 

I’ve started therapy in november and I just feel it does not work. I hate myself more than everyone, the only person who does not deserve my love and appreciation is myself. My therapist says I’m a really empathetic person. Yeah, I may be. Everyone around me keeps judging everyone for literally everything. You wear yellow? We will laugh at you. You like pop? You’re gonna get laughed at. You are not as tall as 180cm? You deserve us laughing over you. I feel like I’m the only one in the whole fucking world that realizes people have emotions and they’regonna feel bad if you hurt them emotionally.

I suck. At everything. My therapist diagnosed me with “social anxiety” and I hate it. I fucking hate it. I’m not an introvert I can tell you. I would like to go out more with my friends. I would fucking love having ever had just even 1/10 of what you would call a relationship. I would fucking love being a normal person. 

I never show my sadness. Never. The first time ever I had to tell it to anyone was in late november when I started writing to my closest friend telling him how much my life is going bad. He was surprised, since at school I’m always the “funny guy ahah listen to his jokes he’s so funny he must live a happy life”. Fuck you all. No, sorry. My bad. You all are normal fucking persons and you deserve everything from life. You are all beautiful. You all have a gf/bf. You all can talk about how cool shopping and fucking and kissing and everything is since you have a fucking life. I’m not being sarcastic here, I really hope everyone I know and don’t know is doing well because no one deserves to feel lonely. No one deserves to punch himself in front of the mirror. No one deserves to “not being able to talk fully about your problems because you are a fucking cunt and you think everyone’s judging”. 

I hate it. Everything I do, I say, I think that someone is gonna talk about it with his friend, and they are going to laugh at me. I do have friends, cool right? No. I always feel like I’m the most fucking useless person that ever existed and all my friends are fake. I always feel like someone is watching over me even when I’m alone in my room or trying to relax. I always feel like I shouldn’t complain because who the fuck cares about me? No one. I should move aside to hear all the problems about my friends, such as “My bf hasn’t written to me yet it’s been 30 mins!” or “My gf and I have not had sex this week so sad”. And I’m always there. Always. I never complain about someone other complaining about his life. Their life matters surely more than mine. 

I’m a fucking clown. All I do all day is trying to get other people to laugh, trying to never ever offend anyone, trying not to show my emotions, saying “sorry” all the fucking time. Therapy is not fucking doing anything, my parents are always nervous since when at home I just walk from my room to the kitchen to the bathroom angry, nervous, sad. I’m an average looking person with 0 self-esteem. I havenever ecieved a fucking compliment about myself m entire life. And when I get compliments for something I’ve done they always feel fake and I never accept them. 

I hate this. I hate myself. I just want to live a normal life. I don’t deserve this. Love you all people always remember you all are wonderful and you deserve everything from life.

depression,"Either you or someone you know probably goes to therapy. For me, it’s every Thursday evening. You show up, you lay down on a fancy old couch, your therapist, who probably sports a goatee and tweed jacket, asks you about your childhood and shows you some Rorschach inkblots. By the end of the session, you truly understand your deep-seated fear of clowns. Sound about right? 

What we just described is actually a fairly outdated amalgamation of psychoanalysis, made famous by **Sigmund Freud**, and **Hermann Rorschach**, among others. And most psychologists can tell you, we’ve moved on from many of these early practices.  

 And while this work has influenced the more-modern psychodynamic therapy, this is still just one of many kinds of therapy treatments for depression. Some more common forms of therapy are cognitive behavioral therapy and dialectical behavioral therapy. 

But that’s just the tip of the iceberg, there’s also music therapy, somatic therapy, hypnotherapy. All very real ways to help people deal with depression.

This continued for the rest of highschool. People keep on telling me its alright. If I'm being honest nothing has ever made me feel more terrible when half of the school would start calling me a paedophile and it has messed me up ever since then.

The thing is, I think I was getting better, uni was gonna be a fresh start and I had a job interview a few days ago.

depression,"hi everyone, using a throwaway to avoid identification.

as i (19F) write this, i'm on the verge of tears and have a lump in my throat for no discernible reason. before this, i spent the whole day lying in the same spot watching tv, save for the one time i got up to make myself instant noodles. at dinner, i started tearing up because i was disappointed with the food (this is kinda embarrassing). my mum keeps asking me why i'm always lying down (not in a malicious way or anything) and i can't really pinpoint the reason but i'm always unexplainably exhausted. the good days are fine and pretty normal, but the bad days (like today) just really suck.

for some context, i'm in a transitional period in my life (graduated from high school, waiting to start college in october). i've had some moments of euphoria here and there that made me feel at the top of the world (got accepted to some really good schools etc.). however, for the most part, nothing really excites me. this is a real low compared to my last 2 years of high school (consistent high achiever, top student for a bunch of subjects, you get the gist) during which i felt some degree of fulfilment because i kept getting told i was good at things. i notice that, when i'm not occupied by the hustle and bustle of school, i always get like this more intensely than otherwise (like during summer vacations).

another thing- every single friend of mine has been motivated enough to get a job and do stuff that excites them. i've barely done anything. the only 2 things i managed to bring myself to do in the last 3 months were the result of me being talked into them by various people. i am a major pushover so obviously i ended up doing them. i just cannot bring myself to apply for a part time job because everyday i just go ""i am tired and i'll do it another day"". i feel like shit because i don't know if i have a problem or if my problem is just that i'm lazy.

my head is really heavy as i write this, so i apologize for my stream-of-consciousness writing style. the reason why i'm so confused is that, when i am in social settings, i'm really lively and fun. i'm also a very typical ""gifted"" kid / overachiever  with much less to worry about that my friends who are on the edges of their seats trying to figure out what to do in the future and shit. i have a loving family and supportive friends. i am grateful for everything i have, but i just get extremely blue and temperamental for no reason sometimes. i don't dare to discuss this with anyone i know because nobody would expect this from me. 

i don't know if this information helps but i typically feel like this during long holidays. basically, if people arent giving me responsibilities, i can't bring myself to do anything.

i'm so sorry i don't have the ability to organise this coherently right now, but could anyone share what depression can feel like? or at least give me a reality check if i really am just lazy and melodramatic? some clarity would be amazing. please be as candid as possible because if it really just is an attitude problem, at least i can stop being self-pitying and start doing something about it. 


just a disclaimer: i have never seriously considered suicide but from time to time i wonder what it would be like to just disappear. don't worry about me being a danger to myself because i would never do it.

depression,"Hi I have never posted before but I’ve been really struggling for the last 6months at least and feel like I’m reaching the end. 
I have worked in the same job for coming onto 3 years. The management there is subpar and very lazy there’s no communication between them and us and for someone like me (a duty manager basically a low level manager) gets dumped with shit fights and busy weekends with out senior staff or managers. This has been the case for a while and since before Xmas I’ve been having a lot of trouble trying to keep my head up especially at work and this amount of stress from work is weighing on me a lot.
 I already don’t have great mental health (on medication for depression/ currently on highest dose and I honestly feel worse than I did before ) *note* I do smoke weed daily and my doctor knows this and generally discounts my symptoms as I find myself struggling to find words to explain how I feel. 
While at work I have noticeably been upset or angry and people have noticed and will ask me what’s up. There’s a big part of me that doesn’t want to trust these people with my thoughts and how I feel as I don’t even know. I do know that I feel like I’m out of place in my world. Kind of a side kick to my own life. Shell of my true self but I don’t even remember who she is anymore. 
I have a great family loving mother and sister (asshole absent dad/for the best/bigger issues there 😂) 
Friends who frequently express their love for me because they know I struggle. Even when I hermit myself away (smoking weed and listening to mac Miller and crying in my car is a usual night ) 
I don’t really know where I’m going with this post I just needed to write something down incase. 
I have enquired abojt new jobs. Even sending resumes out and hearing back from them, not for a few days after and by that point I would just watch the phone ringing with no motivation to even answer the call let alone try and mentally prepare myself for an interview (then what if I actually got the job I don’t think I’d survive the anxiety attack on my first day) 
I did see a therapist for a few sessions (definitely didn’t stick it out for long enough) but I felt so uncomfortable in a “none judgement zone” for being ridiculed for smoking weed (I am 100% aware it is in no way helping my mental health but medication alone isn’t helping and I feel like it’s it’s not bud I’d be drinking myself to sleep every night) so when I started leaving things out (e.g. id say that I’d leave work and chill out by myself and have a breather (which she would say that’s great! Listening to your body etc) when in reality I’d be smoking bud) the second this started happening I was like well I’m not going to pay $200 to feel like I have to lie or miss lead her becausei guess I’m ashamed.  After this I reached out to a free service but similar approach (they were very harsh when I told them I smoke weed daily ) I had to wait something like 12 weeks to actually get an app then I slept through the appointment I’d been waiting for for so long. They have called me but I’m too embarrassed and ashamed to re book. Some kid probably really needed that app and I blew it because I forgot to set an alarm. 
Almost every shift I actually go to work I will get there and feel overwhelmed with anxiety with cramps and sever tummy pains that I usually will breakdown and cry then go “home” aka to go, you guessed it, smoke weed. 
Vicious cycle.
I try and remind myself of the good things in my life my beautiful doggo and my kitty cat as well as family but I feel like a black hole that has no life and is worthless. The pull to the living world isn’t there. 

I don’t want to be living. I can’t see myself falling in love, I can’t even see myself moving out of my mothers home. I don’t have many friends close to me (area wise ) 1 girl the rest are hours away from me and our main form of communication is Snapchat.

I feel my heart sink every time I breathe

depression,"1/ I have been bullied in an online scam for a long time!

2/ Lately I showed signs I didn't want to accept their lies anymore, to which they started sending me threats, that they knew things about me, they would find me, etc!

3/ So far they ain't moving. I'm somewhat 70% sure it was bullshit to reach me emotionally and take more money.

4/ Finally accepted to talk about it, get help, block them, change my phone number.

From all of this verbal oppression, and this threat, it has awoken my survival instincts. Finally, I felt that I really didn't want to leave this life, nor this world, and I am surrounded by people who care, and who need me alive on this space piece of rock.

It was a wild ride I had these past few days: to organize memorabilia of my own self and to assemble together all the piece of conversation I have held with the crooks, so any investigation could be started in case a drama actually occurs to me. I'm not done with the work but this folder will be kept on my computer for a while in case I need to testimony. Maybe I can laugh about it and rave in my growth one day.

Finally, finally I accept to report those shady persons, to believe help exists, and to try to move on.

It made me realize a whole lot how emotionally unstable I was. I have had shut myself in. I've stayed functional all along but not mentally present. This period of time proved me I survived poverty and racket, it has proved me I can stay loyal to myself character-wise even in times of struggle.

And yep! As many of you guys, every morning I used to wake up wishing someone kills me. Maybe I could still feel this when something bad happens to me and I roll my eyes and say ""oh kill me please"", but just those small threats and bully behaviour made me see how it is to fear for my life! I don't say it wasn't horrible but it probably has pushed a *trigger*. The trigger that says: I want to stay alive. Never will I again actively pursue the charms of death. It'll come in due time.

The consequences I'm dealing with right now are shit though. I could lose my job since I reported the incident to my supervisor. I would need to tell my parents before they think I'm stingy for not giving gifts and have nothing to tell them about my life. The threats I've got could become true and end up with me hurt or more, but at least I cut communication from the crooks and I learn again to *appreciate one thing or two* about my humble life.

depression,"I'm on therapy with a psychologist, it is a bit better than without one but sometimes I feel like I don't want to do this really. As if I'm just her job or something.
Now I thought about medication but I'm scared about several stuff that might happen:

- It might cause an irreversible damage to the brain or something, since my problem is probably temporary so it doesn't worth the risk.

- It's not healthy and addictive, another stuff I'm trying to avoid.

- It only works if you keep taking it, so there's a dependence on it which I don't want.

depression,"For the last while these have been my symptoms, and while I’m not looking for a diagnoses (I know I have depression), I’m just wondering if these are normal depression thoughts/symptoms. 

- Feeling no interest in anything and just pushing myself to do daily tasks

- feeling like I have no motivation to get up in the morning

- feeling that life is pointless/meaningless 

- feeling/thoughts that just everyday is the same cycle: wake up, eat, sleep, repeat 

- lots of existential thoughts

depression,"I had my first panic attack yesterday brought on by high amounts anxiety. It felt like a heart attack accompanied by about 6 or 7 other intense symptoms. I was hospitalized and every test came back 100% healthy and normal, ruling out a heart attack. The whole ordeal was embarrassing. I had no idea I was going through so much mentally as I felt completely fine before the attack and there were no “triggering” thoughts in my mind at the time. 

Quick background on myself, I’ve been depressed and anxious for pretty much my entire adult life (I’m 28 now) and for the most part, I left it untreated. I’ve been to therapy a few times, but nothing really came of it. I’ve always been against most medication, especially psychiatric meds, but right now it seems like it might be necessary for me. I’ve tried so many different techniques to help myself, both recommended by therapists, and advice found by research done on my own, to no avail. 

Needless to say, I’m determined to take my mental health more seriously from now on.
And I’m hoping anyone who might read this going through something similar might consider doing the same, before things get worse for you like they did for me.

depression,"Hi, this is my first post on reddit, I don't know if anyone will respond, but anyway, i ll tell you all my story, maybe it s gonna be an occasion for discussion. I was raised up in a middle class family, we didnt have any problems during my childhood, i already knew that there was something that wasn t going so well, but i wasn t completely conscious. I ve always had a shy charachter, closed and sensible, apparently aggressive, but i ve never had the courage for start a fight with anyone, except one time when i was 16. when I was a child i didn t have the same passions of people of my age, first, i didn t really like videogames, i played with them when i was i middle school, but i never fell in love with them, i wasn t intrested in the mainstream films or cartoons, i liked only documentaries. I lived feeling like the interests of others where banal. Ok, this can seem even original and alternative, of course i was, but i had also very obscure sides in my charachter. I struggled all my life, since the maternal school, with inferiority complex due to the fact that i was a bit fat, and some made fun of that, i ve never been very fat, but i was on that way, thanks to my mother who bringed me to the dietologist i ve nevee become obese. I ve always been very short, but this wasn t an issue during childhood. So, i was shy, complexed, sad, introvert during maternal and elementary school. In the middle school i was cast into a world that seemed more the world of adults, but with the behavioural scheme of a child, although i lost the innocence of a child. Middle school was a nightmare to me, i was ridicoulized with no reason by others, also by certain females, there was a group of people that had several offensive nicknames, and we made fun of each other, but i was the one with most nicknames (the bullies didnt have nicknames). The consequence of this period was that i had to make continues effort to rationalize such a brutality, and make it not to distract me to my student s tasks. Anyway, i faced the situation and when i was in 3rd grade of middle school i was feeling very changed, although i knew that those years will have haunted me for years. So i didn t develope any interest and my joy of living consisted in hoping that in high school i would have a better dealing with my schoolmates. In all this i had only one friend, who was in my class in middle school. In high school i was cast in an avironment that was the opposite, because it was a school in the center of my city, but the shith with different smell still smells like shit. Anyway, here again i isolated myself, i didn t manage to socialize, only in 3rd grade i started socializing, in 4th grade i punched a classmate because he was making fun of me because i m short (i m 1,55m, or 5' 1''). Plus, the amount of study was very big, and i didn t get out from that school only because of pride, i could admit that i wasn t able to deal with that amount of work, while my classmates were. The truth is that i was slow in study because my mind was full of complexes, obsessive thoughts and imaginative sceneries, that my mind produced to cope with the harsh reality. Those thoughts were not only due to emargination but also to sexual fustration, infact, my 0 social status, my embarassing height and my neglected look didn t attract any girl, only one time appened, when i was 16, but we never had a true relationship because i was always studying and because she used guys to fill her lacks of  affection. I also had a strange phenomenon, in which i losed completely the sexual desire, although still being eterosexual. Anyway, the high school was so hard, that i didn t think well about wich carrier was the most suitable for me; i thought to knew it, i wanted to be a politician, because i was always interested in social issues, so i decided to attend the faculty of law, but i abandoned after three months because i discovered that i had no interest in studying law. In the period up to the beginning of the new academic year, i thought which had to be my faculty, initially i thought philosophy, because i like reflecting about things and deep questions etc... but at the end i choosed political sciences because I wanted to know the mechanisms of the society, it seemed to me more concrete. Now i m in the 3rd year, and i can t say that i dont like it, but in three years i always felt like it didn t belonged to me, although they are very interesting things, that made me politically mature me...it s very strange. Now i m 22 1/2 and i d like to finish but this sense of unbelonging haunts me. I swing constantly between the thoght of remaining in my faculty and the thought of leaving. I cant say what is the best for me because i don t know what i like because i never experienced thinking freely, because my mind was full of negative thoughts. Fighting with complexes ruined me so deeply that my mind feels tired every time, if i read, thing that i like a lot, i can t concentrate because of intrusive thoughts, if i try to apply to some hobby i can t enjoy that, moreover i can t find time fore hobbies because i m slow in studying. In my country exists a master s degree that would allow me to teach philosophy in high school, but the consciousness of not have applied in the philosophy field  and the inhability even to know if it is my field, make me feel desperate, the complexes for silly things in teenage years have affected my early adult life. Do not forget to live a pleasant adolescence. Sorry for the wall of text, thanks to anyone who will read all this.

but then my mom made me stop going to therapy, as it costs us too much, which was understandable, and yes we can afford it but i don't want to have any more debt to my parents, if im being honest. but then she went ahead to say that it was all *fake* and i don't really need to go to therapy because there's nothing wrong with me in the first place. she claims that i was just too much of a pessimist and that it's all in my way of thinking, and she's not wasting any more of her money for something so stupid. depression is apparently dumb, and anxiety is just an excuse to be lazy.

depression,"I’ve had a pretty traumatic two years, and am currently in a stage of life where I’m focusing 100% on being healthy again (I’ve experienced worse depression and anxiety now than ever). I’m not working nor going to school—literally just focusing on resting and healing.

Problem is that I am terribly impatient with myself, and constantly telling myself that I just need to “get over it,” that I should be healed already, that I’m lazy because I’m not working, that I need to just eat and hydrate and I’ll feel better (by this I mean I barley have an appetite and truly struggle with preparing and eating meals), that I’m the worst because I’m not doing anything that I deem “productive,” that I’m wasting my time because I literally stopped my entire life so I can heal, etc.

depression,"I've been thinking about mood swings recently and realised I've never realised understood what the term means. General definitions say a 'rapid shift in mood' or something similar, but there's never any context to understand what 'rapid' means.

I always thought of mood swings as being unpredictable one second to the next, of cycling through moods several times in the space of a few hours, so said I didn't have mood swings. However I read something, somewhere recently which gave me cause to think the timescale was more day-to-day, than minute-to-minute.

My moods range quite wildly on a day-to-day basis, dark and gloomy and apathetic one day, perky, sociable and productive the next. Whenever I have a very good day, it's immediately followed by a very bad day. Or days that start happy and energetic can switch to miserable over the course of an hour or so, then stay sad for the rest of the day. Are these mood swings, or is that just a normal fluctuation in mood?

Have I misunderstood what mood swings are and been incorrectly answering diagnostic questions for over a decade? Or does a ""rapid change in mood"" mean a more sudden, rapid cycling within a period of a few hours?

TL;DR: What timeframe do we have to look at when considering whether we have mood swings?",What counts as a mood swing?,thisisvic
depression,"I basically have no support system other than my husband. I try to let him know what's going on with me, what's got me down at any given moment (if it's particularly bad).  I think I have a tendency to do that in unhealthy ways sometimes. When I try to sit him down and lay it out, I don't think I get my words quite right. Sometimes it comes out in passive aggressive ways. Basically when I'm really at my lowest, he tends to avoid interacting with me. It hurts, but I don't blame him.

He may have SAD - he gets into a depressive state in the winter months (but hasn't sought a diagnosis or therapy so idk), so I would think he can relate to these feelings on some level.  But he deals with them differently.  The last time it happened, he didn't really talk to me. Things were awkward and I could tell he wasn't doing well. My natural inclination was to check in with him. His was to pretend nothing was happening.  I felt emotionally disconnected from him so tried to explain that (poorly), he got upset and told me angrily that he had been depressed. I didn't know that at the time because he wouldn't tell me despite my asking. It drove me further into my own spiral.  

Basically we deal with our own (and each other's) emotional issues differently. And for me it is painful. He does not check in on me when he knows I am down.  So when it gets particularly dark, I try to take the initiative to just open up to him.

The last time I tried to open up, it was about how I basically lost all my friends during my last bout.  We relocated and I am trying to form new connections, but it is difficult for many reasons.  He also knows about my traumatic past with my family. So at the moment, I only have him.  At one point during the conversation he said he doesn't want me to feel like I need to seek emotional support from others. At another point he told me he thinks that I enjoy being miserable.

I don't know what to do with that. 

I felt like I was getting better for a while, and now I am at a point of stasis. I feel paralyzed in this, and I cannot open up to him. The original issues I tried to open up about don't even bother me as much as what he said, and where we are now.  Sorry for the wall of text. I hope this all made sense.

depression,"So recently my wife and I took a huge leap and moved 4 hours away from our home town, moved in with some friends who were generous enough to let us get on our feet and apartment search. 

Well these friends didn't realize how much of an avid gamer I was. My wife has always known and has always been pretty fine with it despite not being a gamer herself. Gaming was there for me growing up when nobody else was. It is my happy place and my hobby. Not that it goes yo the extreme or anything,  I would just rather play games than watch TV, which is absolutely bizarre to our friends.

The reason I bring this all up is because they look down on me so hard for enjoying them as much as I do. They find any reason to blame these things on us not finding an apartment. Last week alone I did about 20 hours total of apartment searching. The area is extremely difficult to find renting options became  they're either too expensive, for 55 or older of age, or allow no pets. (Which we have 2 dogs.).

So where am I heading with this? I'll cut to tonight. I have felt like absolute garbage all day. I have a disorder with my thyroid that acts up some days.. I didn't do any searching. I called a few apartments to find out they were either busy or close on Mondays. Okay, no big deal. I'll call tomorrow when I feel better anyway. I think to myself, I have enough sick time at work to get paid, I'll call in and rest.

Ha. 20 minutes after my shift would have started my wife comes down stairs. Asks ""so you're really not going to work?"". They were all upstairs talking about I haven't done a single thing help aid in this search. How I have no priorities and would rather stay home and play video games like a child than go to work (which I hadn't touched a single game all day at this point. I was asleep mostly.)

And now my wife and I are on bad terms because I feel like these people who I thought were good friends are slowly brainwashing her. Keep in mind I don't say a word to them about their hobbies. Which include watching Disney movies religiously. I sweep? ""He hasn't done anything in weeks"". I clean dishes? ""He hasn't done anything in weeks"" hell I walk their dogs when nobody is home in the afternoon‽ ""he hasn't done anything in weeks "".

I'm sick of feeling insignificant.  I'm sick of feeling like my wife is a totally different person. I'm sick of anything I do at all is like I'm invisible.  Nothing goes noticed. That is until I put a controller in my hand. Tomorrow I'm going out for about 4 or so hours to search again. Let's see what happens? Ha I already know. I literally feel like if I disappear everyone would benefit from it. Does this mean I'll do anything to that extent? No. I love life to much to leave it. I just feel this way.

depression,"Created this account just for this post.

I was wondering if you stop feeling feelings as you get older? Or if feelings and passions deminish over time? 

I'm 35 now and I think the last time I kinda felt something was when I was around 30 and the last time I felt passionate and excited about anything was probably mid-20s.

I've gone to concerts with family/friends and they were left absolutely amazed and excited.  But though liking the performance I honestly felt nothing; feeling wise.  It was more of an appreciation of talent thing.  And that made me wonder if that's what they are expressing or if they are moved and i am not.

I don't feel anything anymore.  Not really. It's like my soul has departed and all that's left is my body with it's memories running on autopilot.

Now all I feel is nothing ... just nothing... I don't even think emptiness is a good description, it's just, non existence of feeling. On the rare occasions I have felt it was usually the bad feelings: deep, unfathomable saddness, or anger.

I still do things, still keep myself occupied, still talk to friends. I still laugh at jokes, but it's more of a face than anything. Or an understanding of what's funny and an auto pilot mode, or an appreciation of a good joke I guess, but without the happy but it gives. 

... I really want to know if this is just part of growing older or that I'm broken? ...

Mostly I can live as I am. I mean it's not bad pursay, it's just nothing. I can live with that. 

But there is one thing I miss and want back. I was very creative. It was a bit of cheesy cliche creativeness but it was the one thing that I loved. It drove me. It was an obsession that I wished I wasted more time on now, because that love and drive is now long gone.

I was writing a story (I still am but the motivator that drove me is gone and it's now just an action to pass time rather than my every waking hour obsession) ... I actually spent more time drawing and sketching and world building than I did writing. I'd start writing and get super excited and than start drawing. I had bits and pieces everywhere with little scrap drawings and notes. From characters to scenes to lore to props to cities. Everything. A lot got dumped and things changed but it thrilled me. When I was supposed to be studying at uni I was sketching my characters instead. I couldn't wait to get home to work on it more (I also loved uni and other things but they were my secondary interests)

I worked hard to build this world and to write my first book (badly mind you but it's still an achievement) ... But then ... I don't know... somewhere along the track I noticed that I wasn't drawing every moment I could. I wasn't thinking endlessly about my story every waking hour. I wasn't having conversations with my characters in my head like I used to in the middle of the night or while on my walks. My heart wasn't in it now, my heart wasn't anywhere now. 

I'm still writing my story but it's more methodical rather than the exciting passion that drove me. I still draw pictures from time to time but it's purely for visual purpose rather than the passionate excitement to visualise things. I'm still moving forwards but it's like from the memory of it being the most important and awe inspiring and fulfilling thing I was doing rather than actually being those things.

I want that back.

I am constantly triggered, so I'll remember of certain horrible events that happened to me in the past, the ones I absolutely cannot change. Some of them are sad, and make me feel the worst person in the world. However, in other situations, I'll remember of things that make me absolutely angry, pissed off. ""That person who betrayed my confidence must die in my eyes"", etc. So I will just keep torturing myself mentally, screwing up my sleep (which is already screwed up), feeling worse and not doing the stuff I was supposed to.

I'm not going to say that cliche words that all of you have heared of beacuse there isn't enough proof for them to be true but i know one thing for sure , We can help ourselves by just telling ourselves and our mind that we're just fine and doing good .
You know you probably are feeling down for a while and that's why you're reading this post But you should just realiz that everytime you say to yourself that this is how i am ,and i'm going to be this way my entire life and so on so your mind especially your subconcious mind will buy it and it will buy it Good trust me he knows what to do .
So everytime you 're just saying i'm not good enough and things like that to seek help from others , your concious mind just looking for answers to make you good , but instead your subconcious mind believes that there got to be something wrong with this person , And imagine what will happen to it if we just keep doing this thing for a year or longer period of time , we will eventually find ourselves in a rabbit hole fooling around ourselves .

In 2019, LKJ was the first to call me names like attention seeker things like that. This thing spread like wildfire across the class even at my CCA. Like LWT told GYY about it. Somehow, this died down when the cca senior reprimanded that.

depression,"If I have to be honest, it makes me deeply resentful that many girls tend to land in the position of having their loneliness staved off by success stories and through the perpetual, annoying radiating self-positivity &amp; love that is projected. I've gone through series of what I consider a myriad of personal hell, all of which I had to do alone.... and I want a permanent reprieve.

I've come to the acceptance that I will only probably be understood by one or two people... chances of connections are one-in-a-million, even the odds are less when I want is a guy who believes in co-dependency, for which it nurtures the bond between two people.

Most civilians will never comprehend what I've been through. I feel.... that I have to search for guys who'd gone through a specific set of experiences.

I've stayed with a man whom I was very aware of his demons... choosing to be the burden for his PTSD from his time in the USMC... being told things.... that most people would shy and run away from. It didn't faze me. The feeling like he didn't deserve to live, and he was a man of faith. His problems became mine. And I had no qualms. He was the first man to accept me, treat me the woman I was, even if I'm at the moment pre-op MtF trans. I wasn't there when he needed the most, wanting to eat a bullet to the brain....

He believed in that the duty of a man was to protect and provide, the military only to reinforce most of his attitude. He believed in the mantra not many would recognize: *Semper fiat act pea di victorium*.... latin for: *Always faithful to the last breath and beyond*. The eventual parting of that relationship has not been kind, despite being 5 months ago but he has exemplified the standard of the traits that make a better man.

In many ways, I feel so broken. That I'd never meet another man like him, regardless of the connection... willing to endure my frequent breakdowns. Asking me if I liked to move over and live in his place during our relationship. Him trying to plan his expenses in order just to make sure I was safe on the flight to the US, even if it meant sending the money needed to cover for flight expenses, at the risk of being ghosted. Connecting so well, after 3 days. Most people again, won't understand. His flaw... he loved women too much and I inversely, love men too much. What man would do all these things?

He's gone now... and me, I'm still at my current circumstances in life. Very reminiscent of the Virgin Suicides *(from the book and film)* with the Lisbon Sisters. He was the first man to understand the depth I was going through. I felt I let him down... and I carry a great deal of responsibility.

*Esprit de corps*... never let a fellow marine down.

Crippling depression, isolated, felt like I was robbed of experiences of much of my life which I'll never get back, limited by the absence of experiences others seem to be more fortunate at. And now... I'm thinking of wanting my life to end, passive thoughts of crossing in the middle of a busy road ensuing.

My greatest wish.... is for life to grant me an encounter with a man who is equally protective and caring. Fiercely so, believing in co-dependency and that a woman should feel weak.

Ensuring that there'd be frequent messaging, voice calls.

**It took a man whose core profession was to kill enemy insurgents in Iraq to understand me. A tortured man to finally understand another broken soul. After 12 years of loneliness, being alone and isolated as a result.**

In some small sliver of hope, I want a man who has undergone similar experiences or at least, in the infantry whose occupational role is of combat.

I'm tired of having to carry the weight of my experiences with no one to share that I feel comfortable around.

A man who is selfless, whether a close friend or more. A man who has conviction...

My only, close male friend is also in the USMC. Infantry too... and even though his responsibilities prevent him from frequent messaging which is expected, I can't help but think it's a matter of luck that he found me, and continued to nurture a connection for so long.

I wish I could tell him my problems, but there is a certain level of barrier that prevents that, mostly on his end on the side of empathy by nature. I don't want that our connection to devolve where I become a liability. And I surely don't want to depend on him in that he's not the type of man that can emotionally satisfy me.

More and more, I feel myself ebbing at the ability to connect with most people in the civilian world. Or perhaps just most people in general.

I've been abandoned time and time again where I felt like I'm holding sentiments as my partner did. ""*Time goes on, I'd feel more distant, cold""*.... as he puts it. I worry that's happening with me.

I guess you can consider a plea of help, help that I don't want to regret in making. If you're a current AD/vet or even considering enlisting, I'm asking for anyone receptive to just... want to connect.

At the very least, someone my age *(17-21)* who can relate to the experiences I'm feeling. Someone who wants to connect long-term.

I plan to move to WI *(Fox Cities area)* in the distant future, it doesn't help that there's nothing for me here in Australia but oh well.","21 MtF - Most people will never understand what I've been through and it's exhausting.

depression,"I just know that I'm going to be alone for the rest of my life. On the one hand I feel completely undesirable. I'm disgusted by my appearance, I find the thought of anyone being attracted to me ridiculous. If people communicate that they are, I'll immediately assume they're fetishizing me (I'm a trans girl so that actually  happens, which is very yikes), or attracted to me for aspects of my body I'd prefer for people to not even notice. 
They say that's what's on the inside that matters, which is where things go downhill for me. I don't consider myself a good person. Not even an OK person really. There's nothing about myself I like, I'm boring, annoying, shallow and narcissistic. I pretty much only talk about how much I feel like shit, or misread situations and make jokes at the wrong time or take jokes too seriously and kill the mood.
To top it off I can't accept affection. If anyone is nice to me I assume they do it out of awkwardness or pity. If that doesn't work I assume I fooled them and proceed to be shittier and shittier to them to prove to them that being around me is a bad idea and they should take distance to protect themselves.

depression,"For this to make sense, I'd have to give everyone who's reading this a little bit of context. 

Last year, when things were starting to look bad and everyone had to be locked down, most of my friends stopped talking to me (I was somehow ok with this) but one person in specific used to be my ""lifeline"" if that makes sense. As long as I had her in my life, as long as I could talk to her, I would be ok (I'm aware I was wrong in making a friendship something more than it was supposed to be). The thing is, this person stopped talking or interacting with me as well. She went completely radio silent for the entire year after a consistently great friendship for 2 years... Let's just say I didn't take that well at all and started going down a dangerous trend of self harm and self doubt. I used to spend hours every day theorizing what I did wrong and why this would happen just now instead of any other point in my life, stopped eating reguarly, stated cutting myself again and also just shutting myself in my bedroom with all lights out, just staring at nothing and crying. I felt sad, lonely and mostly abandoned by someone I thought I could trust. While this was happening, she was still active on social media and still active overall, she just decided that it would be best to stop talking to me (And I still don't properly know why she stopped, but I guess I just stopped caring about it after so much lonely suffering and moved on). 

My current issue, however, is that after making up my mind and moving on from her and all things related to her, I just lost interest in pretty much all the things I used to love. My emotions are very toned down, almost like nothing matters as much, and although I am at a ""peaceful"" and calm state of mind, I can't help but find it all so lifeless. Life itself is lifeless right now, nothing makes sense. 

I just want it back, I want those emotions back. Living without feeling is just as bad as living with negative emotions clouding your head. If being negative always made me want to end it all, not feeling much makes me want to end it all just because it may make me snap back from this state.

i hate how i have all of these fucking opportunities staring me in the fucking face and i do nothing.

i hate how i find very few things enjoyable, and even when something is, it just will randomly stop being fun for no reason.

i hate how, no matter how certain i am that im going to kill myself, i never fucking do.

i hate how, depite the fact that ive been like this for years, i have never properly told anyone i actually know.

i hate how, no matter how insecure or hurt i feel about something, i always pretend that i do not give a shit about anything..

i hate that i cant focus on my work no matter how hard i try

i hate how despite my friends being online a lot of the time, i barely ever start a conversation with them

i hate that i always give up anything i try in the early stages, regardless of how interested i am or how fun it is

i hate how i ignore important emails and stuff because i just cant be assed to deal with them

i hate the fact that i can easily cheat in most of my tests because i know absolutely nothing about what im supposed to

i hate how ive gotten this far in life without really trying because everyone thinks i am trying and working hard when im not and i fucking hate it

i hate how i always compare myself to others with depression and constantly try and convince myself im not actually depressed

i hate how i have a pretty good life, all things considered, and i have no reason to be depressed

i hate that i have never tried to get help

i hate that i cry so fucking easily

i hate myself",i dont think there is a single thing about myself i actually like,bobbster574

depression,"Previously I didn't have any mental health issues at all. Suddenly I started to feel like I was stressed and it developed into anxiety attacks and fatigue. Went to the ER and followed up with my PCP and medical tests came back normal. 

I tried several things to try and feel better again. Things like exercise, spending time in nature, hobbies, changing diet etc. This help some, but my symptoms were still bothersome. For this first time I went for a mental health assessment. They said it was anxiety or possibly a medical issue. 

Currently I'm still struggling with anxiety and then started to get vivid dreams with a restless sleep. I'm always thinking about how I feel. I walk around feeling empty. I back for more help from mental health professionals and still didn't get anywhere. They just asked me what was making me anxious and showed me ways on how to relax.

depression,"I’m a few days away from turning 15 and i think i have depression. 
I’ve been having thoughts of suicide for about 4 years now. I even have a few failed attempts. Back then, the only friend i had would call me names and make fun of me for being stupid and fat and my sister would hit me a lot. I didn’t see a point in living. That same year i got interested in music and started feeling better but i still would feel like killing myself every now and then. Im concerned it has gotten way worse. 
The only thing that motivates me now is music and even that isnt enough to make me feel better anymore. I had the grades to go to an amazing school but when i got accepted i didnt even feel happy. And now i can’t even concentrate on any of my classes.
Ive wanted to tell my parents for a long time but i feel like they dont care. They’re constantly at work and i get to see my mom only on the weekends because of her job. And even then i dont talk to them. 

A few months ago my sister and i got into a fight and i had to lock myself in a room to hide from her because she was going to hurt me. I immediately told my mom over the phone and she came around an hour and a half later. When she came i told her crying that i had enough and that i wanted everything to end and she said that we would go to family therapy. She has not said a single thing about it since. I think she thought that i said those things because i was angry and not because i meant it.
I want to get some sort of help but i feel like if i tell them they will shrug it off and say my failing grades, sadness, stress and stuff are because of lack of sleep and tell me to sleep more, even tho ive told them that i have trouble sleeping. And if i tell them of course my sister will hear and make fun of me. I dont think i have the power to tell them.

depression,"First time posting here, need to get this off my chest and can't share all of this with my friends. This is gonna be a long post, my life in a nutshell. Maybe someone has patience to skim it to give some advice and judge how normal it is and if there's some hope.

I'm 30 and I've been depressed since my teen years.

I have absolutely no happy childhood memories. My father is an alcoholic. He lost his job, and almost every day when I was coming back from school, I used to see him lying on the floor unconscious, covered in his vomit. My mother took all the responsibilities of raising me and my siblings, but she was very harsh, punishing physically and criticizing us for everything. We were extremely poor and she had to work to support all family. When I started having mental health issues, she used to tell me they need to ""lock me up in an asylum"", and also that we should be grateful to have parents at all, as orphans have a much worse life. Seeing a therapist has never been an option, it's something for ""crazy people"", and ""normal"" people are supposed to be too busy to be depressed. That was my mother's view.

Finally I left my hometown and eventually moved to a different country and cut any contacts with my family for several years. There was no communication at all, but after some time I got messages from my father informing that he disowns me.

I got into a relationship with someone 30 years older than me, who was a psychological abuser, criticizing me for my appearance and cheating on me constantly. My pretty much nonexistent self-esteem was ruined completely.

I used to cry every night, but long time ago I reached the point when I'm too tired of everything and have no energies even to cry. I've never seriously attempted suicide, but I think about it every day, and I don't care about my life at all, always take bad and risky decisions.

It took me some time to recover from my first abusive relationship, but then I quickly got into another one, now with someone of my age... It seemed much healthier at the beginning, but I still slipped into a severe depression, got fed up with everything, and compromised my bright career just to live together with my new partner. I discovered they were cheating on me all of the time, but I had no strength to confront them, and it only intensified my self-hate. When I could not bear that anymore, I just moved to a different place for a random job, with no savings, leaving all my possessions behind.

After one year, I lost my new job during the pandemic. I was actually good at it, almost being a workaholic, but my contract wasn't renewed because my employer allegedly had financial difficulties during the quarantine... I even ended up sending an embarrassingly personal email to the boss describing my financial problems and how I hope not to be left unemployed in these times, in a foreign country. The answer was one line, something like ""we have no funds to renew your contract"".

In the middle of everything I started dating someone again (before covid) and made new friends, but I could never share all the details from my past with anyone around me. Even when I was broke to the point of starving, I tried my best not to tell anyone and deal with it myself.

I guess now I'm ""okay"", I moved in together with my third and last partner, who treats me so much better than anyone had, but my depression never goes away, and I can't fully open up about it. I constantly think how terribly I was treated by my exes, at all my past jobs, by my family, and that life hasn't been fair to me in general.

At the moment we live together in a tiny rented apartment, both unemployed due to covid, on some savings, and I feel very anxious about the future.

My partner convinced me to reconnect with my parents, and I guess it felt nice at the beginning, but I can't share anything personal with them, and they basically keep saying that my life has been a horrendous failure, and I should consider moving back with them to my hometown.

I don't have specific plans to commit suicide, but I think about it every day, or at least about death in general. It doesn't scare me at all; there's even some relief in thinking that this could end soon.

I'd seek for a therapist and antidepressants, but I'm really broke. This is all a terrible combination of my depression that has lasted for at least 15 years (with rare minor improvements at some points) and the problems I have to face now.",Need to get this off my chest,yawatiworhtlli

depression,My Parents decided that they give away our Mother cat and 4 kittens.The only thing that made me happy through depression.It's because the mum was eating too much food and The whole family was pooping at the CR way too much.I told them that they could move to my grandfather's house so i can visit them once in a while and keep in touch with the cats.But they are giving it through a relative i hardly know.I feel suicidal.You may think im dumb but That mither cat has some begginings with me i'll never forget.I was walking home from school as usual back then.Then i saw a kitten that was in a box behind a tree.It was the now mother cat.She was a calico cat and Looked adorable.I adopted her.Nothing big happened.She just made some kids with our other cat we adopted a year after which is also calico and didn't give birth to calicos (stange).But she always would go to my bed and sleep there.She would wait for me coming home from school.When she saw me she would run and follow me to home.With the kittens.I always play with them.Anyways.I fucking wanna die.I love my cats so muvh just to be given to a relative i don't know.I'd shoot a fucking sniper through my face.Fuck this life FUCK FUCK.,Im Lucky if i live through this.,AhriTheFox27
depression,"I know some people have trouble sleeping at all and some people sleep all day. What's it like for you?

I myself dream every single night and it's causing me to sleep for up to 14+ hours a night sometimes.

I feel like I'm stuck in this loop where I wake up but I  immediately fall back asleep after switching sides and the dream I was having continues. When that happens I realize I'm awake but it feels like I'm not actually awake, if that makes sense. It's really hard to explain...

I never feel fully rested when I wake up.

Whenever I actually wake up I just can't bring myself to get up for another few hours because there's nothing for me to get up for. This usually results in me falling asleep again and I feel even worse afterwards (headaches, eyes feel heavy, really hungry/thirsty, etc).

depression," I have always treated people like a priority, whether it was a friend or someone I'm in a relationship (recent unfortunate events), but no one ever reciprocates the same energy, in return, I am always treated as an afterthought by people, and it just fucking kills me. Am I only useful as long as people need my help or something that'd benefit them?

The feeling eats me up inside and I lose motivation to do anything especially when someone I really love does that to me e.g. my best friend or the human being I thought would be different and I loved to no end. Welp, they have all proved that I am a worthless POC who is only good enough as long I have something to prove my worth. You may be wondering what unfortunate events I am talking about, well I can give some examples like leaving me on read and replying after hours, if I vent out to them the best I get is ""oh damn that sucks"", ignoring my snaps if I ever feel like sending them which is extremely rare and I only send them to people I am extremely comfortable with which btw is now zero people :)

I looked into my therapist a little and found out she has very different political views than me and I know she’s a professional and would probably not let our different views interfere with counseling but I don’t think I would feel comfortable bringing up certain things to her anymore.

depression,"i’m a senior in high school and for the past 3 years i’ve drifted completely. besides a few really bad breakdowns/episodes (i’m bipolar-schizoaffective) i have literally felt nothing but something varying from complete apathy to a slow-burning hatred for the past 3 years. i just sit in bed all day and do nothing. i can’t muster up the energy nor the care to do assignments. i’ve failed almost all my classes the past 4 semesters. the ones i passed i pretty much just had to grift my way to a passing grade the past week.

depression,"Sorry for not updating for a long time, been a rough time softly said. Citalopram 20mg ended up doing jack shit for me. I used it for over 2,5 months, No negatives nor positives. So my psychiatrist switched me over to Prozac as my mother also uses it and she thinks it works. 

So far I've been on 20mg Prozac for about 5 weeks and it's helping a tiny bit. ''Less thinking, more doing'' kinda thing. That said I've been in psychotherapy as well and done a ton of talking with psychiatrists, doctors and psychologists so its hard to judge if its the meds doing it. I'm most likely going to up the dosage to 40 or even 60mg to see if the effect is stronger and confirm if it really is the meds or the intense psychotherapy.

I started this thread to write out my journey into medication, I had a lot of fears, mainly and childishly I guess the fact it can affect your sexual motivation or even cause permanent dysfunction, luckily I have nothing of that sort and everything is still '';normal''.

Prozac so far had caused some excessive yawning in the first week that has passed, and now results in intensive dreams and a tougher time to fall asleep (wandering/active mind)

depression,"TL;DR: I haven't seen a therapist, so I don't know if I'm sick or just making excuses for my actions for more than a half decade. I've numerous suicide attempts, but haven't been successful since I was always caught by my parents (because I still live with them). I hate seeing and interacting with human beings and society in general, and therefore don't have any redeemable skills in general to live in this cruel world. I might have a severe case of anhedonia, but I haven't been diagnosed, so I'm not sure.

I have been feeling emotionless, and devoid of worth and reason to live since in middle school. I tried being the smart kid and the clown kid, but when I entered high school, I threw them all away and did what I wanted I to do. I always hated my teachers' and classmates' guts because they blatantly show their disgust in me (in the case of my teachers) or simply ignore my situation (my classmates). I was one weird kid and I became weirder as the years go by. I guess they didn't understand me because I won't go to school for a month and just go back like nothing happened, but it might be just me. I had a few friends, but they all left when we graduated.

The reason for me not going to school is because it's draining. You ever had days where you don't want to get out of bed because you know you'll be doing the same routine you've done for more than a decade? It's tiring, isn't it? That's what I felt. Add to that, I just hate seeing those people's faces. They seem...happy (even with the thought of shaming someone else), and I'm not. I don't know why I'm not happy. Like almost everybody else. I never understood what's there to be happy about.

I figured that I might be depressed, but I don't want to call myself that. It sounds...not right. Probably because of other people romanticizing it these days. I tried picking up a hobby, like drawing, playing vid games, watching, and reading, but I couldn't get myself to do it. My head feels empty and I couldn't get past through to what I was supposed to do. It's been like this for the past 3 years. 

When I graduated, I told my mom that I won't attend college because I had numerous nightmares about school and I don't want to relive them all over again. She understood me, because she was there whenever I came home from school angry. I would punch walls or scream, just to let my anger out. I'm quite aware that I have anger management issues, but I've never done anything to work on that. She was also there when I was always called to the guidance counselor's office due to numerous truancies. She suggested that I should see a therapist, since this attitude of mine has been chronic, but I declined. I live in a third world country and mental health therapists are scarce. Mental health here has always been a taboo subject and is always reserved for those who are totally deranged.

Since then, I've spent my days inside my house (I still live with my parents and I'm totally dependent on them), and I've never left. I hate going outside, and I hate seeing human beings. I've developed a distaste towards them, enough to call myself not human. I hate society and I hate the system. Sometimes, I would feel remorse over what I've done to my parents since I'm exploiting them and being a worthless bastard. I'm at a loss on what I should do. I can't work because I hate people, and I can't work because I can't bring myself to work. I'm afraid that I'd be treated like trash again. And I think I'd just skip work whenever I feel like it. Am I lazy, or am I sick? Am I just making excuses?

I thought, ""Since I'm worthless, why not just be a fossil fuel? That way, I'd be useful."" I've always contemplated suicide, tried countless of times, but I was always caught by my parents since they're always home. It's hard to find an opportunity. I'm torn between offing myself because I'm no longer useful to my parents or offing myself because I want to end this limbo of a life? Do I even need a reason? I didn't ask to be born, and my parents don't deserve me as their child. The worst nightmare I'll ever have is when my parents die before I do. I'd be left alone and wouldn't know what to do, but I'll never let that happen.

Anyway, I just wanted to let this out since I couldn't think of anything to do. I tried watching some anime awhile ago, but I lost interest immediately. I hope the opportunity comes.",Hello.,zdzbgsild

depression,"Life is getting harder for me. I don't know who I am or what I want. That's why I decided to employ living codes- the Monochrome Code and the Vivid Code. The former is all about seeing every potential relationship as a liability, so as to avoid the pain of losing the associated person. It's about building a wall around to safeguard against emotional suffering and thus avoiding the search for love and affection. It employs ""Fuck you and your society"" attitude. I'm bipolar and thus it really gets difficult for me to face rejection and the feeling of being left out. But at the same time, I feel like I'm missing out a lot.  

While the Vivid Code is about coming out and trying harder to assimilate into society and appreciating life. It's about having hope and expectations.

depression,"

My life has never been worst. 

I always felt like a misfit, even my friends. It was always like that, everywhere I went and everywhere I go. I am 15 years old, so I am in school and this year is so far the worst yet. Everything happened at the same time. Where I live, the pandemic really wasn’t so hard on us (until now) because it is such a small place, meaning that schools were open for the past three months. The only thing was that we had only one group instead of eight different ones (one for every subject). So three months ago, when we received the list of our class, I was thrilled to be with my friends!.... Long story short, the one I was the closest with (who talked with me about the other girls in our group in their back for months) told them I was the bad one for doing it and that she was only doing it “not to upset me”.... I admitted that I was wrong, cried a lot for a long long long time and felt like the worst. “God I am just the worst! How could I talk in people’s back like this!”.... So what did they do? Become friends with everyone in my class and talked in my back to them..... which I later learned they did all along, just like I did them.. I never felt so hated. 

To add to that, classes take ALL of my time. I have harder maths and science (I don’t know the exact term in English). The teachers are complete psychos, not to mention that we see them everyday. I was always good at school. Now I have to work for weeks on a subject to even pass. I cry all the time. I have no time. Wake up, eat, class, come back home, homework, eat, bed. That’s it. Everyday. And on the weekends, I have to work. I feel restless. Tired. Not happy, at all. Terribly alone. 

And finally, my boyfriend. He is amazing. I love him so much. I have been going out with him for more then two years. We went at the same school, but now we don’t. I saw him everyday, and now I could only see about 4 hours a week if I was lucky. And as of right now... we can’t see each other for a whole month or more because of lockdown. I can’t do this without him. He is my only reason to live. He is so understanding of everything. From my free time being so small, to my condition called vaginismus which makes penetration unbearable... he gets it all.

I don’t see an end to this. I am already empty and the biggest part of the scholar year is coming up, and I can’t see my boyfriend and have almost no friends. Well I do, but like my boyfriend they are not in my school so I don’t see them either. I feel alone. Sad, deeply deeply sad. I always wanted to do some big big studies but I changed my mind. I don’t want to continue anything. I want it to stop. I can’t do it on my own.

depression,"Hey Alex,

I always say there’s a turning point. I always say that tomorrow’s going to be different. After this bath it’s going to be different. After I eat this meal it’s going to be different. Everyday I tell myself the same lie that I’m going to do something different - I’m going to study, I’m going to work, I’m going to socialize or go into the dating scene or something like that.

And for the past two years and a half\*, I haven’t done most of what I wanted to do. Congratulations, me. I’ve moved out, you know, successfully. I have my own place\*\*. That’s pretty cool. I have enough money. That’s great. But what about the other fulfillment, you know? What about my social fulfillment? I just got laid out of work, you know? And it’s not because I wanted to quit, even though I hated working there, it’s because of all these negatives are just pulling me down.

^(\* break up with a long-term 3 years relationship, where we lived together, due to stress and a dead bedroom.  Took me over an year to feel 95% about the breakup. I since only had sex with one other person since, without any meaningful romantic relationship)

^(\*\* since starting my college life, I lived one semester in a frat, one semester in a dorm-like facility, then an year with my parents, two years and a half with my ex, two years with my parents again, and now sharing an apartment with my best friend for the last 6 months)

And this is just another report, this is just another turning point that doesn’t exist. You know, no matter how many drugs I use\*, no matter how many highs and lows, how many I’ve been deceived by thinking that everything’s okay, you know. It’s not like that.

^(\* This sounds more exaggerated than it is. I recently experimented with shrooms and LSA and bought BDO to try out later. I don't drink to mellow out my sorrows and I do not smoke.)

Alex, you need help. I need help. Professional help. For real.

But every time I think about it, I think “yeah, I’m going to do this later, but I am going to do it”, you know. Because of the anxiety it brings. The thought of having to call someone and talk to someone and do things in general has been debilitating my life since, since eu conheço eu por gente, since I have been. It’s not longer just a social anxiety. Because the social anxiety came with Luana\*, right? I stopped being active on messenger, and it always has been a downhill battle from there. I manage to do the base minimum, and sometimes, not even that.

^(\* messy high school breakup that lead to depression-like symptoms, lost interest in a lot of things I love and broke away from social media, never 100% recovered since)

It hurts to know that… It’s tough, working on your own. I don’t have any classes that I have to attend otherwise I’m going to fail, it’s all on my own. And having that lack of someone, you know, checking me out, someone looking for me, someone that I have to prove myself to, and only having to prove to someone that is myself is, well, it’s devastating my life. I can’t handle it, myself.

If classes are online, I can just do them later and procrastinate myself. I’m already feeling it, I’m going to procrastinate this whole semester of college again and then I’m going to, you know, and just say I’m going to do it next semester or two semesters and that’s going to be it, forever, I’m never going to change, am I? I’m always going to be me.

But this has to change, you know, there’s a difference between Alex and the person who Alex wants to be, because that’s also Alex, that’s the future Alex, that’s the grownup Alex. You know?

I want to be this person that can thrive, can maintain an active social circle, that can enjoy things again, that doesn’t have any anxiety when…

Man, my anxiety took a downfall, huh? I keep thinking and creating expectations for new experiences and I don’t experience them – it took me a week to listen to the new Persuader\* album, it takes me years to play any new videogame, and it’s all because of this generalized anxiety.

^(\* basically a favorite band of mine)

What have I been doing that hasn’t been airplane mode, autopilot, for the last year or two? I’m finally unemployed and that means going after jobs myself, and sincerely, I’m up to the task but I’m not sure I’m up to the task. Life has been pretty easy for me for the most part. I’ve had a job without trying, I’ve had the best, well, the only relationship in my life without trying too hard, I’m living with someone else, with my best friend, and it wasn’t a mega effort or anything. Everything comes easy. And you know that, deep inside, it’s there, you know, this anxiety, this depression it’s there.

Ever since Itajubá\*, you know that can’t live by yourself, because you know that if you are by yourself, you’re not self-sufficient, you worry about your future in the United States\*\*. You worry that, when you get there, you’re not going to get a job, and it’s not because of trying it’s because you’re not going to try, it’s because you’re going to fall in this depressive state.

^(\* moving out for college was a disaster. Moved out of an abusive frat to living in a place where I socialized with nobody. My mental health wasn't pretty back then. I moved back and got into my current college)

^(\*\* I was born in the US and am currently living in South America. My plan is to complete my free college education here before emigrating)

I know you. You know yourself. But you try to hide it. You try to think, well, that’s for future me, I can solve it but, I’m not solving it man. I’ve grown older, my political views have matured, sure, I’m experimenting with drugs, which is something I always wanted to but, yeah in my career I’m learning a lot but, it’s still the same me. It’s still the same state that I’m unhappy of. Like, do I need to be like this, all the time?

I want more. I want more from life. I think that, I’m not getting enough. Because I’m not even getting enough as a baseline perspective. I’m living here, and I’m not cooking enough, I’m not even exploring myself, doing stuff that I can do own my own. Where’s all the new cooking? You’ve learned one or two new recipes but that’s about it. Where’s the new stuff?

I don’t want to believe that I’m doomed to my same old ways, I really don’t. I really want to do believe that there is a future where I am more capable, and self-sufficient, and happy. I’m not so numb, where things happen in my life, major things, and they just pass by. Why does everything pass by? It’s lot like a big blur but…

Alex, you need to live life. And it’s hard, I understand. You don’t understand people the way that other people understand people. You’re different, your brain’s different\*. People have to connect to you for you to connect to them, it takes a while to connect. But there are people out there, you know, dudes that want to hang out with you, or girls that want to hang out with you, even though if you’re weird. I’m not sure if it’s a matter of embracing my weirdness or not.

^(\* formally diagnosed when I was young with Asperger's. I'm mostly normal but you can tell if you get to know me)

But I need to face this, I need to accept this. But how do I even start? Do I just go to a random psychiatrist, psychologist rather and just start blabbering about, “hi, I’m this guy on the spectrum that has been living off anxiety” Did I really waste two years and a half of my life for anxiety? I don’t know.

On paper, I’m not so bad, I know enough of web development for a junior, mid-level position, sure. I can handle myself. But I need more from my life. I need much more.

This was supposed to be a memo, to myself in the future, but it’s not, it’s a twelve-minute-long rambling. And it hurts, because, if you’re not numb, you feel it, but if you’re not feeling it, you’re numb and it going to be pushed to the back of your head tomorrow. Good luck. I really need to get my shit together.

Love yourself, Alex, don’t fuck up, as I have fucked up.

But that’s it, that’s about it. Get therapy my dude, get therapy.

depression,"With 2020 coming to an end, I think now is a good time for reflection. This year, while awful, has been amazing at teaching (at least me) things. This year, I noticed behaviors I had that needed adjustment, found a new hobby, and realized that I wasn't a ""good"" person. 

When I say a ""good"" person, I mean that when I started to reflect on myself, I noticed that I hadn't been the real me for a very, very long time. I allowed the people around me to influence me so much, I lost sight of my values. 2020 has shown me that and shown me who I really want to be. I noticed recently that I never had any hobbies. I loved to play video games and watch tv/movies. This stemmed from high school, I never really had any friends that I hung out with regularly, and the only time I had a good experience with people was when I was alone, or when I wasn't in my home town. 

I've started finding joy in things I do again. This has led me to want to live again, but not without remembering the lessons I have learned.

Here are the changes that I am actively trying to make:

1.) Generosity - I want to volunteer more and donate more to charity

2.) Creativity - I want to be more crafty 

3.) Positivity - This one is going to be super hard...

depression,"I have a very, very rough life, like everyone here. I’ve been through many abusive “relationships,” but i’ve only ever dated once in person, and that was back in 2018. And in all of them, they broke up with me. I didn’t want it, but they did. 

All of my friends tell me I’m amazing, and what’s sad is it took 4 of them that i treasured close to my heart completely degrading and reaming me for shit i either didn’t do or was exaggerated to make me look worse to make me realize that. Friends i trusted with dark secrets. Friends i trusted with very easily misunderstandle/misinterpretable situations and secrets. Friends that, in hindsight, abused me and utilized my loneliness and feening for giving affection for their own gain. They conspired against me just to tear me down. And yet i forgave 2 of them... (the other two went too far, even for me)

But even if i’m amazing, i’m still undesirable. I look homeless because i don’t shave/trim, people assume i’m older and have called me a pedophile and creep for flirting with girls my own age, and my hair naturally dreadlocks itself. I have a pretty bad lazy eye, and without my beard, i look like i’m 12. I’m told i’m attractive, and i’m told i’ve an amazing personality, but not a single person i meet is into me

What’s even more sad is i literally met the perfect person for me. In every regard. I’d have a chance if she wasn’t taken, but that honestly doesn’t make me special. But even if it did, i i shouldn’t need to feel special for something like that. And because she’s so perfect, i honest to god don’t want anyone else. I’m just honest to god in love with her, and i just want her to be happy more than anything

I’m off track... with literally everyone i meet, i’m just a friend. I’ve never been anything more unless someone who’s abusive thinks i’m good enough and will deal with their shitty treatment enough. I’m honestly easy to abuse, and for the most part, it’s what i know. 

I don’t know what it’s like for someone to want me so much they gush when they see me. I don’t know what it’s like for someone i don’t know to give me a compliment on my appearance (unless they’re contradicting what i said about myself). I don’t know what it’s like for someone to see me and just want to hug me. I don’t know what it’s like to be treated like i matter, at least until i get suicidal; then i matter. But all my friends know what it’s like, and if you think i’m assuming, i know for a fact because i’ve been like that with them. 

I only have 2 people actively in my life (aforementioned girl becoming a 3rd, so that makes me feel better), and very few people who won’t leave me on read constantly. And due to this, as well as being high functioning autistic, i’ve very poor social skills, especially with more than one person present. Coupled with a fear of rejection, i don’t even try to make new friends often. That fear of rejection is why i missed my chance, actually. I should have just asked her, but i decided to take it slow.

This isn’t a post for advice on dating; like i said, everyone else will just be disappointing now. I already know what it’s like to not be enough, i don’t need to give someone else that damnation. I’ve just finally come to realize that i will never be desirable to anyone. At least, for nor more than a punching bag or someone to catch you if you fall

im a very empathetic person and since i remember it makes my life a struggle. i was diagnosed with a depression, anxiety and bpd as a teenager (im 28 now) and through the years i like to say i got better cause i worked hard (im also on right meds). but there are things that also got worse for me. 

when i was an angsty teen i used to read and watch terrible stuff on the internet and i mean even the dark web level kind of stuff. why? i have no idea. it was unpleasant and i would say traumatic. in that time of my life i saw and read about the worse things that people are able to do to another being. when i realized how many vulnerable kids and animals are abused and raped daily something broke in me and its getting worse and worse. 

i remind myself about the dark reality all of sudden, more and more often, in the weirdest situations. i have visions in my head that are terrible and i cant ignore them. my heart is pounding, my throat is closing and tears coming to my eyes. and the realization that i cant help and save make my mind weaker and weaker. i was always suicidal but because of that i got worse again and started to think about suicide daily (and i was free from that for like three years). 

i have no idea how to deal with this. i tried to desensitize by educating myself more and more on the subject, take it as a simple reality that i need to accept, but it doesnt help. i like to call myself an activist, i do everything i can to make things in this world better but its always not enough so singing petitions and donating money dont help either. and im tired. cause no matter how hard i try to help its still a drop in an ocean.

Between the ages of 17-23 I spent everyday that I can remember wishing I was dead. I’d written countless notes, thought up 1000s of different ways that I could end things but I never did anything. I could never go through with it, so instead I would hope that something would happen to me which killed me so I didn’t have to do it myself. Driving to work hoping that someone would hit me head on, going to the doctors when I felt something funny and just praying that it was something terminal.  
  
I cut myself a few times but never really consistently did it or felt the urge to do it. Whenever I did, it was mostly nothing, not deep enough to leave scars. The only thing I can see now is the faint scar of me carving ‘not good enough’ into the top of my thigh.  
  
My last girlfriend fucked me up a bit as she was extremely affectionate and would always lie in bed with me telling me how much I meant to her, how much she loved me and she’d never felt this way about anyone else before etc etc. Suppose I should’ve been a bit cautious considering we had only been together for a matter of months but I lapped it up instead. She ended things, got back with her ex boyfriend who’s an abusive piece of shit and when I showed a bit of emotion about things coming to the end she then started calling me a weirdo because we had apparently only met ‘a couple of times’. Her saying this tanked my confidence even further, I felt like such a mug for believing anything she said and also just the fact that someone could lie to my face for months and fake all this lovey shit and then just drop me so easily without a second thought was pretty devastating to me.  
  
I don’t really know what to do anymore, I’m pretty sure that all my problems stem from my anxiety, depression and self-worth issues but I don’t know what to do about it. I went to my doctor 2 years ago and they prescribed me with Sertraline and kept upping the dose when I said it wasn’t really doing anything.

depression,"I’ve struggled with depression and anxiety for the majority of my teenage years and early adulthood (21 now). I started to struggle when my life at home started to deteriorate. My dad, who likes to drink had started to become increasingly aggressive to me, he would blow up over anything, threaten to kick me out, or try to intimidate me or just yelling verbal abuse at me every chance he got. I felt very self conscious and truth be told, I started to believe everything he would say and it really took it’s toll on me. I began to withdraw myself from my friends at school as I had become extremely anxious. I missed more and more days of school as my attendance had always been great before instead choosing to stay at home and lock myself away in my room sleeping and watching YouTube so that I could avoid my dad and the world. Soon after this I sank further into depression as my gran died. This broke me completely and my mum, who has been the best mom I could ever ask for was shattered by the lose of her mum. At home it began to seem evident that as I would stay in my room for the majority, my dad had turned his anger to my mum...although never being violent towards her, he would try to make her feel like shit and put her down, then sometimes act like nothing ever happened. It was horrible to see that my mum who always defended me against him, was now becoming the recipient of his anger and I felt guilty for not doing anything but terrified of the consequences if I tried to intervene. My mum does everything for us, works full time and takes care of my grandad and is not argumentative in the slightest. I could see that the stress was taking its toll on her. Yet as her husband it seemed like he was only interested in pilling on more stress and making the house a very toxic and uneasy place to be. 
During this period I began to think that it would be easier to just not be here anymore as I couldn’t escape my all this stress, negativity, anxiety and had no motivation for anything. 

This went on for a few years until I eventually finished school and racked up the motivation and decided to get a job, and start trying seeing my friends again to combat my shitty home life although many had moved on with their lives, I was grateful that there were still a group that I felt wanted me around.
Things were starting to look up, despite life at home still being miserable.
Even though I had a job now, which I was able to keep myself together for, I would still feel anxious and stressed, sometimes over the littlest things. My grandads health has now started to deteriorate, and my mums health seems to be getting worse as well and she’s still having to put up with my dads shit. She had asked him for to leave but he refused and when she asked him for a divorce, he told her that she would have to sell the house, something my mum can’t afford to do.

I had also I plucked up the courage to ask out a girl I had liked for sometime. I fell for her way harder than I could of imagined and this only grew as we started to see more of each other which was difficult as the pandemic took over everything. 
Whenever we were together I loved it but I couldn’t help but feel anxious and stressed that she would call it quits after a while.
It eventually happened a couple months back and it has hit hard, just a few weeks before it I had been signed off my work due to anxiety and stress after breaking down in work and since then I have spiralled back into a deep depression which I can’t seem to shake and all I seem to have is negative thoughts, whether it be about worrying about my mum, grandad, the future, thinking about the girl I dated. It’s so overwhelming and I feel that I am such a burden on my friends who have their own stuff going on and I don’t want to constantly hassle them about how miserable I am and my mum who already has enough on her plate without having to deal with my problems and doesn’t need anymore stress. I have now fallen behind with my college course and yet I know it, I can’t seem to find the motivation to even get out of bed and do daily activities. The prospect of interacting with people is so daunting and makes me anxious, even with my friends.
I have never been so low and I can’t help but dwell on everything that has happened. I am now on anti-depressants which I was always reluctant to use, have been really struggling to sleep and having panic attacks when I get stressed.
Waking up each day just doesn’t seem worth it.

depression,"Lately, my depression has been pretty bad. Recently, I've also been diagnosed with Inattentive ADHD. My family has been less understanding and less open to letting me teach them why I am the way I am. That was nearly the last push until I decided to go and chat with my ""closest friend"" because that's what any couple or group of close friends do right? When one is feeling down their close friends usually say ""you can talk to me when you need to."" That's the usual with close friends right?? 

Well, I guess I'm wrong about that because the other day I messaged them about being depressed and mentally exhausted. Keep in mind, this particular ""close friend"" has been pursuing this goal of becoming more extrovert/more social. Now, I'm not against anyone who wants to chase that goal of getting out of their shell. I encouraged that certain friend to keep pursuing that goal but the more we talked over the months the more I noticed their change and it wasn't a change for good. The more ""extroverted"" they became with their new friends the more of an asshole they became. 

Their greetings over texts slowly turned from that typical friendly name calling that any best friend would do to a less friendly teasing like ""hey/sup freak"" or ""how's it going boring ass,"" and more insertive/not really giving me an option ""we're going to be in a video call in 10 minutes."" 

Anyway, this change showed its worst face when I msgd them for support during this wave of depression and it was one of those times when you could feel it in your chest wishing for your actual death. They replied back with ""haha loser,"" and ""good vibes only.""

At that point I just fucking gave up on them and ended the friendship there. In all honesty I should've ended it earlier when the red flags were right in my face.

I'm writing this because I think it'll be good to get everything off my chest. I've been suffering from depression, social anxiety &amp; suicidal thoughts since I was 11 maybe 10 (I'm 27 now). I say 11/10 because to be honest I don't remember anything before that. The parts I do remember aren't good ones, I remember the mental abuse my mom went through and the ones I went through from my father. Ever since I was little I was made fun of by my father and people at school for being too skinny, was called a fag and other names. But the names didn't bother me as much because I've heard them all from my father. Growing up I would contemplate suicide constantly, it got to the point where I would just dream about it. But I wouldn't do it, cause that would hurt my mom and other family members. The only real reason I have killed myself is due to other peoples feelings,  since I don't technically have any that I'm aware of. I've accepted that I'll be alone forever and that doesn't even bother me. It's weird cause I've come to be numb when it comes to my life, I don't even know what I want to do anymore. Nothing really makes me happy, or at least truly happy. I laugh and am happy at times but inside it's like I'm watching through a window. I enjoy crying more than laughing, cause at least when I cry it helps let out all the years of family members dying and all the feelings I've held in. I don't cry when I see death, I haven't even when I was little. But I do cry when I see people happy.  
I've cut ties of all my social media this past year and it's helped a little. I get attached to people to easily and that has caused troubles in my past relationships. I hope to fix my issues and make my life better, but I know it's going to be extremely hard with how I am mentally.

So I never really used to have issues with depression until I moved to the city and went to grad school. I started seeing a psychiatrist because the 100-hour weeks were proving so difficult. 

I graduated with my master's and moved away, have my own place, a great job, and friends and parents who care about me. I have no reason to be depressed. I feel like crap because of it. There are people all over the world with much less and they're happy, and here I am in a first world country, educated and I guess I'm successful, and yet still hoping that some mornings I just don't wake up.

How can I get over this guilt? It certainly doesn't help me when trying to fight my depression. 

I was on prozac for a year and it was great, but I was doing so well this summer that I tapered off of it with my doctor. I got back on after a bad episode in October, and it didn't do anything. I couldn't feel anything and felt like I was living life watching a movie after 8 weeks on the meds, so we're tapering again. 

I don't know what to do. I want to be free of this illness, I want to be free of the meds and any pharmapsychological treatment.

But you don't have to accomplish anything big to be amazing, cause that you already are, spreading joy with your fun personality, helping others, caring, listening...so thoughful and sweet. You are doing great.

I love you. Maybe not in a romantic way maybe yes, idk. Why is that so bad? Just want to know you and spend time with you. Make you feel happy. Want to be there for you. Maybe I'm just obsessed, I guess you could feel like that, but I would not do anything you don't want to. I just admire how decent human you are. You always make me smile. I could tell you anything and you always find something positive or give helpful advice, or when you joke around, just the thing that you write me makes me happy. You are so thoughtful, sweet, supportive, caring, funny, cute....guess I'm not a good friend anyway, I only make everyone's mood go down. Well then, I'll just be here until you let me, you go have an amazing life with good people, who make you smile too, you deserve the best.

So I will keep it under control, never act on my feelings, pretend I'm ok and live hoping one day I can at least give you a hug. You matter to me a lot. Never want to loose this. Am sorry.

So, using some of the tips on this sub, it's been 2 days I managed to convert my depression to high functioning depression.

But then I have to shut all the other activities. And due to some personal problems, I have recently gotten a lot of additional stress and anxiety.

For now, I am holding up. But I don't know how long it will go on(I will not kill myself, it's just that I am beyond help and I don't wanna go to the psych ward). 

People have a lot of expectations from me and what they do not realise is that I might not be able to meet them.

I have been suffering for more than a decade, I have tried everything (including 10 treatments including amphetamines like MFD) and nothing works decently.

They dismissed fibromyalgia but I don't think the chronic fatigue, and in a month, after waiting almost a year, I will have the results of a sleep study.

If there is a sleep apnea I may have improvement, but if there is not, there is probably no treatment or anything that will decrease my fatigue, memory and concentration problems, etc. There are days and moments that I can hardly think of anything; my cognitive and physical abilities are bad for someone who is not 30 years old and has not taken any illegal drugs.

Polysomnography result being that it will completely determine whether I will want to stay alive and I feel that soon I will be able to be released and say that at least I tried. Whatever the results say, I know I'll live at least another year or two, but maybe that's it.

In spite of this, I have the will to live, I have many dreams and things that I would like to discover, but in my current state there are many days that I can barely get out of bed, I have continuous dizziness and I barely enjoy anything, it's like crawling continuously. Years ago I believed in pharmaceuticals, in therapy, even in other alternatives, but after trying with them I remain the same. Not the same, actually worse, because as the years go by I feel my health deteriorates.

I walk almost every day between half an hour and an hour, this year I have worked for 6 months, and I have advanced as a person, but my health has not improved, on the contrary, I have my doubts if having passed the Covid has left me worse.

If I could be born again, even if life was not entirely easy and I had other kinds of problems, I would do it without hesitation. I have never really lived, and it is something I would like to do if I were minimally well, the very few days that I felt good I saw that living could be simple and wonderful, but what I have is so far from that...

depression,"Hi everyone!

Like a lot of people, I've had a rough year. I have a pretty fun job, a roof over my head, some money, a nice dog and I'm healthy but it's been rough emotionally.
Even though I have good things going on for me, I've always struggled with self-esteem, shame and boundaries. At 30, I've had my first relationship this year even though I had gone on many dates before and had quite a few opportunities in the past. It lasted 4 months, we quarantined together and it turned out she had borderline personality disorder. I broke up with her because of her toxic behavior, it was rough (you can read more on my profile if you want). I met another girl a few months ago but she broke up with me when I told her I didn't want to have kids. My therapist is happy with my improvements and she congratulated me on taking risks and trying to build relationships. But I feel like I'm even more alone than before.

We tend to go for partners that feel familiar and this relationship with a person with BPD made me realize that my mom might have the same disorder. It made me realize how much work I have to do when it comes to boundaries. I was programmed to be a doormat and I was taught that sacrificing yourself is how you love someone. I'm overly sensitive to others' feelings and tend to feel ashamed of my own desires and take conflict as rejection and a proof that people hate me. My guess is that my mom was always unstable, always unhappy and demanded us to be her own personal medication. My dad has always enabled her too and is emotionally distant. In short, I've never really experienced healthy love (or attachment if you prefer that term).

All of this made me realize how much I don't  want people to use me or exploit me anymore. I want to give and receive healthy love and friendship and nothing else. And I don't have much of it right now. The only person that fits that description is my sister, we've always been here for each other. I have a few friends but I feel so far away from them. I'm almost always the one contacting them and the one that said I was her best friend suddenly became distant (I talked to her about that, she's still acting the same way). I won't visit my family for the holidays because I don't want to deal with my mom's toxic attitude. I'll spend the holidays alone. I have fewer and fewer people around me and I'm afraid this is a repulsive thing. You need friends to make friends, a lonely person is a red flag even though I consider myself an interesting and pleasant person to be around... I always feel like I'm starting over and over again with people, constantly having to prove my worth when I just want to be accepted for who I am and to be considered...  I'm always trying not to be clingy but I may need a bit more reassurance than other people and that might be, again, a red flag. It's tough to balance that need for love without using others as medication like my mom did with us : it is a rule for me, you're allowed to have issues as long as it doesn't hurt or use others.

Basically I've been grieving all year. Grieving during my breakups. Grieving for my ""friends"" or the idea I had of them. Grieving for my family or the idea I had of them. I'm grieving for the normal attachments I should have learned. I don't know what to do with people anymore, I don't know what to do to earn that tiny bit of real love I need, I don't even ask for much, just someone who is truly there.",A year of grief.,RemasteredNewVersion

THIS IS ME:

They say life goes away
That mt heart doesn't belong to me
Rough edges surround my purity
Makes me feel empty

Lost and tired, no energy
I don't see no end to it
It all seems like suffering
Leaves me thinking, pondering

Is this me, is this how I'm meant to be
Am I my worst enemy?
Diseased insides rot my core
All that's left is not me

I get up and fight the cause
Hope vs hopelessness
I just hope I'm there to see
Who shall have the victory

This is not me
I'm not rat for therapy
Life for me is not a study
When will I get to be

Simpleties are my nightmare
Tragedies bring clarity
Suffering in harmony
Loneliness vs company

Bit about me:
Diagnosed with depression when I was 15. 23 now.
My insomnia began when I was 15, woke up every hour, EVERY DAY OF  EVERY YEAR. That shit has fucked me up lol. Developed IBS, potentially coeliac the hospital thinks. Found out I had a brain tumour when I was 20. Got it removed, caused partial damage to my vocabularly. Life goes on. About a year ago, I became obsessed about buddhism. This shit fucked me up lmao. This drove me into a spiral of thinking about how attachments bring suffering, and that I need to become a monk and abandon everything that is meaningful in my life like my family (I have obsessive tendencies). Then 3 months ago I had a seizure (goodbye drivers license and my job) and back on my meds.

Went and saw a therapist a few days ago (seen before, really clicked with him) and wow, gives me some hope.
I really hope everyone with depression is seeking professional help.

I didn’t do anything, of course, because a 10 year old doesn’t really understand the concept of death and what it means to die. I just knew I didn’t want to be here anymore.

Ever since I was little, I've had problems with nail-biting, ticcing, stuttering, compulsive eating, phobias of various kinds, performance anxiety and mild dysthymia. But these symptoms were never severe enough that they affected my ability to function to a large degree – it just felt like they were part of who I am.  It was not until I learned of what happened during my childhood three years ago that I became seriously depressed and suicidal to the point of completely losing my sense of self, resulting in my grades dropping in high school.

depression," 

Hi, I’m 20 (M) and just got into a lunch fight with my father. It’s going to be a long post, so I apologize in advance, but I wanted to share the more details that come to my mind right now.

A couple years ago, when I was with my first (and only) gf, I started going out a lot more (I was always staying inside my house before) and I got to know a different family from mine. Since how they accepted me almost instantly as a part of the family, I started realizing how a bad and frustrated person my family had made me in 17 years, so I started “neglecting” them (which means staying with my gf most of the day and dining at her place every once in a while).

My family didn’t like this. Even if I was happy for the first time in my life, I saw how this didn’t mean anything to them, because they would have preferred knowing me locked in a room playing videogames all day rather than not seeing me at all for hours. They didn’t even have the “you’re not applying for school” excuse because I started studying seriously for the first time since 5th grade. They just wanted me to stay silent watching tv with them or faking to care about my father’s mom, who never was a grandma to me.

See, my father was raised by a mother who won’t show love but will expect every member of the family to fake love for her, even from grandchildren she never (luckily) cared for. Because yes, she never tolerated my mom (she was the daughter of an immigrant. Not even an immigrant: I’m from northern Italy and in Istria-Dalmatia there were many Italians who fled from the tyranny of Tito. But she wasn’t enough high in the upper society of a 70k town forgot by God). The rare times she talked openly about my father’s family, I heard that her father in law wouldn’t even talk to her directly at the table, but instead did through my father. I don’t mean to excuse her, because I’d never tolerate something like that, not from a person who won’t have the balls to stand for me in front of their parents, but, you know, “that’s the way dad is”. Also my mom was not blameless, being so jealous of my gf and her mother she blamed anything she could on her, like the fact that I didn’t accept to go to the Ivy League college my father wanted me to, and like what I’m about to tell you...

It was my 18th birthday, and as usual I was at my gf’s place to study, since next day we had a test and her place was way better to study cause her parents worked all day, while my mom (a teacher) was always watching tv in the afternoon next to the “study room”. Obviously I had to pay my respects to my grandma, since I was becoming a man and she had a big gift for me (it was a lot of money but I’d have preferred a hug from a grandparent who I was fond of, like my mom’s dad who died when I was 12). I was studying very hard, when my father called me to say he’d pick me up in 10 minutes. I kindly asked him 10 minutes more, because I wasn’t finished. Obviously he overreacted, and yelled at me I would be in his car in 10 minutes. I don’t know why I didn’t have the balls, but I got out as soon as he was there. Not that I didn’t comment on that in the car, saying I just needed more time to study. This was his excuse to make a scene such as nothing I saw before from him or anyone in my family. He started cursing blasphemies (we have insults against god in Italian, and even tho I’m an atheist you’ll guess they’re the worst thing someone can yell), punching the wheel, and telling us how he was sick of us (me, my mom and my older sister), how he truly hated us and wanted to get rid of us. While my sister was crying, my mom was trying to calm things down like nothing was happening, as always. She convinced him to take us to his mom anyways, and after a bit he did. Yes, we had to act like nothing of that ever happened. I had to pop champagne and to talk to the person who gave birth to that like I wanted to be here. And later, we had a dinner planned out, which obviously couldn’t be canceled, right? We went there autonomously and before I got in, after hours being cold as ice, I started crying while I was calling my gf to explain what happened. I then had the most embarrassing and bleak dinner I ever had. After an hour or so I fled to my safe place, my gf’s house. She didn’t have the time to give me gifts during the day since we had to study, but as she gave them to me and comforted me I remember I felt I wasn’t part of that shit that called itself “family”, because I realized family was what I wanted it to be. That was one of the best moments in my life. She and her mom offered me to stay overnight, but I had the silly idea to ask my mom for consent and, since she wanted to make everything seem normal and knew that maybe that would be the first time of many more, she asked me to come back “home”.

Meanwhile, my father disappeared. He went out of the bedroom when he knew we weren’t around and went to work as a rat avoiding mousetraps. Days went by and staying at my gf’s place became a habit: I’d come back home just to sleep. All of a sudden, one day my father pops out and has lunch with us. I assumed he reconnected with my mother. After a silent lunch, he said to me and my sister he was sorry, and continued saying to me:”BUT you could’ve acted differently/better”. He meant that he made a scene cause I disrespected him, by asking him for 10 minutes more to study. I didn’t accept his apology, and went on staying with people I wanted to be with, coming back home for dinner or lunch just to placate them. But it was never enough for them. Just like that apology was not enough for me to forgive him, or the way my mom handled the situation was not enough to respect her.

In the following months I had many fights with my mom, because obviously she had constant fights with my father who wanted his son to be home and to respect his parents. I tried to talk to her but she was so blind she blamed everything on my gf, as if the reason I hated my father was her telling me to and not my father being a jerk. Fast forward a few other months, and during the summer before going to college my gf breaks up with me, basically leaving me without a family or a safe place. It was last summer, and I started suffering from depression. Now that I felt something I knew everything I had before her was nothing, and my life was pointless. It always was, but now I was condemned with awareness.

I then went to university and noticed I couldn’t focus on anything and I’d never be able to pass an exam. So I just didn’t try. At least I had music keeping me alive. But nothing else. In December I decided I’d drop out to find a job in a bigger city, anything to run away from that family. In late January (2020) I finally told my mom what I was up to, never really telling her the real reason because I didn’t want to hurt her. While the previous months I’d come back to my hometown twice a month, this time I packed the most stuff I could fit in the suitcase and said goodbye to my room. When I got to the train station by bus (1 hour from my place), both my parents were there and tried to convince to reconsider because I was making the wrong choice, begging me not to go. I could not care less and told them it was what I wanted, and that they were making me late for my train. I started looking for anything, even the worst and less paid job just to get out of there, but a couple weeks later a pandemic burst out. It could not be but the machination of some angry deity. Bars close, businesses go bankrupt, restaurants fail, and there’s no job for someone without a degree nor any experience. Depression kicks in and I relapse: video games. “Just a couple weeks then I’ll get out of this -I told myself- I’ll get out of this”. Months went by and my rental contract expired (late July), leaving me with no choice but to go back to the place I so badly wanted to leave.

Quarantine with my parents has been fun: every now and then they knock on my door and get in, to convince me to go to a psychiatrist and to convince me to change my mind through the worst and most embarrassing talks I ever heard. “Because I love you so much” says the careful father. I never gave them an inch, as being silent about most of the stuff I see and hear during those horrible 20-30 minutes I have to sit at their same table is more than a full time job to me. “You have to smile and laugh more” says the smiling father.

Yesterday, after 2 months of blessing silent, my father knocked on the door before dinner, and for the first time told me something different: he told me if I wanted a job so bad I should look for one in the area. I couldn’t find anything in a big city, so in a town so small I was pretty sure there was nothing for me, I told him. But he kept on saying that the world is carrying on, that most people are working (he apparently likes very much to take the limited reality he sees as a general truth), and that he didn’t want to see me doing nothing, because he loves me so much. About that I agreed, and I told him I appreciated the stimulus and I would look for something, even if doubtful.

Today we were having lunch together with my sister, while my mom was working. As she got up to take care of her puppy (my father didn’t want a new dog, and I told her and my mom they could do whatever they wanted as long as I didn’t have to take care of it. I love dogs, but I didn’t want to get attached to a dog I’m not going to see in a few months). He’s just a few months old, so he’s pretty unruly, and my father didn’t hold back and started complaining about it looking for my consent. He told me “well, we two fought together not to have this dog in this house”, and I replied “Nope, I didn’t fight at all: I just stated the dog wouldn’t be my responsibility. I really don’t care”. He said:”Mine was just a comment, you could as well tell your opinion” to which I replied “that’s my opinion: I don’t care”. He got mad and told me “I wonder what would be your reaction if I treated you the same way” “Surely I wouldn’t react like you”, as I would quite frankly prefer him not trying to be my friend. “Oh, you would react way worse”. Sure... Anyways, he tried to ask me if I already looked for a job and I told him the truth:“Not yet”. He asked me why and I asked him if he expected me to find a job in two hours. Again, this was an excuse to go crazy and start telling me I’d be idle for 20 years, and if someone really wants to get a job he gets it. I told him to cut that insipid rhetoric, but he started saying how much he busted his ass to get where he is now (as if he wasn’t born rich), to which I replied:”So you think there are no people out there who bust their ass and gain nothing?” He obviously got even madder cause I wasn’t submissively accepting his truth. Then he threw it out there:”And by the way, I still think your choice is wrong. You’re so confused” as if he was trying to help me. I just replied “I never thought you changed your mind I surely didn’t either” and went to my room since I realized he would start repeating the same things he told me for months, locking myself in as he was yelling at me to respect him and to stay there listening to him. He revealed his true self, for the second time in my life, and started pounding on my door yelling he was about to tear it down, while my mom was in the middle of an online class. She got out and tried to calm him down, while he still yelled he wanted respect, and that I insulted him by going away. I yelled at him “This is surely the best way you’ll have your respect”. He then went to his bathroom and fled to work. I told my mom “If I see him again in this house, I’m out”. She asked me to explain what happened, and I told her exactly. She obviously knows he’s out of his mind, but she told me “he was being patient trying to talk to you” “What? He was being false! Being patient is me holding back my need to open the door and punch him in the face, being false is him putting on a mask to hide his true self! I’m not staying in the same house of such a crazy monster”. I’m sure my mom will do nothing but try to talk him out of his madness, while I’m not sure I can afford to let this slide. I don’t think I deserve to live in a real-life theatre and to get mad because of them. I just have one friend who I’m not sure cares about me anymore, maybe I should try to ask him for help? I rarely did, because I don’t wanna feel like a burden to others and maybe from his point of view I am the one neglecting him. Maybe he would offer me to stay at his place for a while. But we haven’t seen in months...

If you read this, thank you, I really appreciate you. I needed to get this whole thing out, and to collect my thoughts. I’m sorry if it’s messy and way too long, but that’s how I’m feeling right now. Maybe not long, but messy for sure...

depression,"I’ve been depressed for most of my adult life. My depression started at puberty and I’m 27 now. I’ve sought out help here and there. Mostly trying therapists and dropping them fairly quickly. A brief stint with medication and a few holistic remedies. For a long time I was in denial but I am fully accepting my depression at this point because it’s become too obvious to deny it.

I’ve tried recently to start talk therapy with two different establishments that offer affordable therapy for those without insurance. For some reason, I never heard from either. I have a feeling I need to be medicated but like I said, I don’t have insurance. I am pretty hopeless and I’m not sure what to do next. I’m in a relationship with someone I love very much but he’s not depressed and I feel like my situation is dragging the both of us down and I feel incredibly guilty about this. 

I’ve let this go on for so long that I don’t have any hobbies. I’m down to only one friend aside from my boyfriend. I want to do something productive or have a passion but I don’t know what I’m interested in. Every now and then I try something and it seems pointless.

My sense of smell, I realize, is also depleting as years come by and go along with my alertness in hearing. I'm only 16 but I just feel so meh, lost, and I guess scared? There is no passion here anymore. My sense of taste is more of a comfort and a double-edged sword. I'll gain weight more and more, but I'll manage to feel something.

depression,"It's been like this for years, I've been like this since I was really young and nobody at home seems to listen to that voice crying out. No matter what I do I don't do it good enough for my parents. I'm 17 almost 18 soon and I am just really tired of being around people who do nothing but invalidate my emotions and make me feel like I am not wanted here. Both my parents, I'm sure, are mentally ill as my father struggles with childhood PTSD and my mother with depression and anxiety. Neither gets any help for it because they have that backward stance of thinking that these are things you should suppress in order to overcome them. I know this is oversharing...I know i shouldn't be looking to strangers to talk to but I don't feel like I have anyone else to speak to who won't get annoyed with this and leave me all alone IRL. My older sibling who's no longer in the picture left because of the way she was treated by our parents. At the time I really resented them for leaving, I was really hurt knowing I'd be all alone and the one to clean up their mess. I hated them for doing so. I hated the fact the I was already suffering from the collateral of their own messes with my parents and now I had to deal with the damage from them leaving. Both of my parents don't accept they're the reason she is gone. It has been 5 years since I have spoken to my sister and every day I really miss her. I don't blame her for taking her pain out on me anymore as I know now that she was struggling in her own way. I forgive the pain she caused me because I know that it hurts. But I really can't do this anymore I can't fight this pain yknow. I've ignored it for years every time I'd get screamed at and asked what was wrong with me and why I was avoidant and anxious I'd take their advice and try to forget and fix the problem. These days, especially with all the COVID stuff, I sit in my room. being at school was at least an escape but now I feel like I'm stuck in a hell world. I don't enjoy being around them this much and as I grow older it only seems to get worse. The year my sister left I thought I wasn't going to make it. I was really heartbroken about it for some reason but they told me to not let it get to me and to just focus on my process. I wanted to talk to someone about it I wanted them to reach out their hands and tell me it is okay to be upset and miss her. But every time I did that I was called weak. To this day I'm still called weak and I suppose it is true. I think 5 years is enough time to heal but who knows at this point. It's really hard to motivate myself to do anything when I know I'm not going to live up to that standard. The hardest part of this is being sober. I've been sober for a while now, 9 months about I think... And taking pills and smoking was a great way for me to escape. Without that though, hurts me more and it feels worse but I know this is for the best. I used those things in order to stop hurting myself I suppose that they just hurt me in another way instead. I guess I'm writing this because today I woke up with a very unpleasant experience of my father screaming at me again and telling me how much of a loser I am. I cried for a little because I was scared but now, I'm disgusted by his words and I'm just sitting here watching anime (which is the only thing I've done in the last 3 days) I find that it helps me escape pretty well and it makes me feel like a kid again.

I think it's really helped me get out of depression.
I used to stay in bed on my days off, I'll save you the story because if you're depressed you probably have a good idea what my life was like.

I wasn't suicidal, but I would have welcomed a t-bone from a big rig any day of the year.

Before I couldn't really reflect on my depression. I just was.
Now I can look back and see how I was, things that may have caused, triggered and compounded to create my 30 year depression.

I don't often offer suggestions.
But if I were to offer any advice based on my personal perception of reality.
It would be to tell someone who says they love you (regardless if you believe them or not) that you need help.
Replace carbs with fat.
Replace sugar with protein.
Replace you're morning wake-up routine by including some laughter.
Remove any toxic outside influence from your life (if they don't understand, they don't need to.) Just move on.
Idk if this last one helps but Reddit is the only form of social media that I use other than YouTube if that counts.

I hope this helps someone.
It's helped me. Three decades of being angry, sad, misunderstood, and silent about is no way to live.

depression,I'm tired of no motivation. Being a jobless fucking loser for an entire year. Tired of having no appetite. Starving myself. Of hurting myself. Of being an addict. Of sleepless nights. Of feeling nothing. Of never leaving my house. Of the deep inescapable loneliness. Of anxiety. Tired of suicidal thoughts. Tired of life. I wish I could just roll over and die. All this pain has turned into pure anger. Towards myself. And the world. The world doesn't even look real anymore. It doesn't feel real. I'm so numb sometimes I dont even feel the wind on my face. Its like I'm watching some sick horror movie slowly unfold in front of me. And there's no where to run. No safe place. Because its in my head. I cant run away from my own head. Its kinda attached. So either I detach it or I do drugs to put the movie on pause for a little. But my mom drug tests me now because I went to rehab twice this year. So the disgusting shit keeps happening and I cant stop it. Its always picking up pace too. Never slowing down or staying the same. It gets worse. And worse. And worse.

I applied myself at school and got some good grades. I practised bass for an hour every day, only skipping that very rarely. I studied every day, stretched every night and exercised, made my bed every morning and applied to a bunch of extracurriculars. I talked to friends and began reading again (I haven't been able to concentrate on that in years)

Only now I'm slipping again and I don't know how to stop it or what to do.

I woke up a week ago in that depressed state again. I got a lower grade on a paper and the perfectionist in me is absolutely devastated. I don't have the energy or motivation to study and I can barely pick up my bass for more than 5 minutes without wanting to cry in frustration because I can't do anything and I'm awful at everything. I can't focus and I'm spending hours staring at the wall, or just laying down with my eyes closed thinking nothing, feeling so sapped and like I'm staring up from the bottom of a well.

It's not fair because that one month of doing well when I usually consistently do like shit has made this even worse. The things I signed up for are actually happening soon, I've been accepted, and I don't even feel happy. Just dreading them because I'd rather lay in bed doing literally nothing all day.

depression,"And here we go again.. A day filled with anxiety. It feels like every time I have stuff under control things go to hell. Here is a little backstory about what I have been through.

I have hydrosefalus. It has to do with the water that protects the brain. It's constantly changing. But my water didn't disappear they wey it should. So I have a small pump whit a small plastic tube implanted. And when everything works as it should. I'm normal. Sadly it malfunctioned so I ended up having six surgeries in one year. And because of that I now have brain tiredness. And that changes my whole life. I have to meditate every 2 hours, I can only walk 600m, I can't be in a large group of people. I have to move forward in life so I try to study 50% at University. It's 125/150% for my brain. So I'm studying over my capacity. I don't even remember a morning when I wake up and feel good. Every day is a struggle. 

A bad day as today I wake up and realize that today will be a difficult day. I eat my breakfast go out on my 600 meters walk and I hope to make it 700 meters soon. I walk 2 times a day. On a really bad day it might only be 1 time. I skip school because I don't want to make my brain tiredness worse. ( so far I only have one assignment that I haven't done.) 

Anxiety is apparently mandatory when my brain tiredness is bad. And I honestly don't feel like have someone who cares to check up on me. I could literally disappear and it would take a long time before no one noticed 

My love life is a joke and dating apps have taught me that I'm not worth shit. I have had the apps for years. I did have a break for 7 months two years ago. Sadly it did not well. It was safe to say that love hurts. 

No to what I'm proud of that I have achieved.
The surgeries that I whet through were at the last year of what we Swedish people call ”gymnasium” ( 3 years before you can apply for University) so I couldn't graduate because I didn't pass that last year. But after my time at the hospital I went to a ”folkhögskola” where I could both rehabilitate and finish my last year of school. I was there for 2 1/2 years. During that time I manage to improve my situation ( baby steps) and finish school with top grades. So I'm now studying at university and continuing my rehabilitation.

I can't see me ever getting another job. It's too late, I'm not qualified in anything useful and I don't even know what I want to do anyway. The thought of having to go outside is pretty dreadful in itself (I'm currently still working from home which has just let me wallow in my unwillingness to do anything much), let alone go through the rigmarole of fighting for another job, even if I could find anything - which I can't.

I can't play violin any more as my teacher obviously can't do lessons right now, and without someone listening I have zero motivation. I can't do anything for myself alone, because what's the point?

depression,"I feel completely alone and abandoned. I want to talk to someone but I feel like I have no one to talk to. There are plenty of people who say they’re there for me if I need it but,, there’s so many reasons I can’t go to them. Or I can but somehow my mind and body just won’t let me. I’ve tried crisis hotlines— I’m terrible at talking on the phone, it triggers my anxiety, and the last time it got bad enough I tried calling a crisis hotline, I ended up panicking and hanging up because I misunderstood what the woman was saying so many times I felt like I just had to give up. I know I have some friends who would listen to me, but I can’t. Either they’re asleep, or they’re too busy with their own issues to give mine real attention, or they’re not helpful with emotional support, or simply the pressure of knowing that they know me, that they’ll be there when I wake up tomorrow, that I will have burdened them with the most raw and difficult to look at parts of me and they’ll continue to be around me, stops me from going. My parents are sleeping in the other room. I know they’d want me to go to them, but something stops me. What would I say? What would I do? How could I face them? They’d ask me what’s wrong and I wouldn’t be able to answer. I used to have someone I could go to, someone I could be completely and utterly honest with even when I couldn’t tell anyone else, but they’ve grown,,, distant. Put up walls. I don’t want to blame them for having boundaries. But they’ve asked me effectively not to tell them when I have really bad thoughts because it stresses them out so much. But what do I do? They’ve told me to talk to a therapist— I’ve been working with one for many months now. They’ve told me to write it all down on paper or in a document— that would just make it worse. I don’t want to be alone with my most self-destructive thoughts. I don’t want to write down every way I want to harm myself and then just stare at it. When I’m alone with myself, my own thoughts and urges just echo back at me, but the echo only grow louder and louder. I feel like it would do more harm than good. I want to make all my feelings public, to cry for help from people I trust most, but I fear the consequences too much to go through with it. I feel alone. Empty. I don’t want to die, but I don’t want to live like this. I’m afraid of where this is leading. Recently I’ve been considering things I never even let myself contemplate before. Substance abuse, mostly. Drugs and pills and alcohol, or medication for my issues. I’m scared. I feel like I have nowhere to turn. Like I need to give up a part of me in order to stop being in so much pain. I’m so scared of being alone. I don’t want to be alone. I feel like the one person in my life who I could trust is slowly abandoning me. Does anyone else know what it feels like to have everyone in their life feel empty and fake, like meaningless smiles and supportive words that carry no real love or kindness or care behind them? I just want something real, the true and unconditional love and support that the people around me claim to give but that I don’t feel. I don’t want to be alone. I’m so scared. I’ve always feared the people who say they love me are going to leave me, and even if they don’t want to right now, that this is the beginning or even the middle of a long, long, long process where they drift away from me and slowly distance themselves and put up walls and eventually they realize it’s just not worth it anymore, and they go. I feel like it’s happening. It makes me want to do drastic things. Like letting go of all boundaries and becoming someone’s slave or their puppet and doing anything just so they’ll stay with me. Or just plain offing myself, so I don’t have to cope with the agonizingly slow process of reaching that future in which the people who said they loved me and would stay with me have all either left completely or shut themselves off emotionally so they’re not truly there even though they claim they are. I just want love. I just want to be held so I can cry, or to have someone truly listen and respond and comfort me as I share every awful thing I’m feeling without having to keep secrets or filter myself. I don’t feel like I’ll ever be loved the way I need to be loved. I feel like I’m always going to be begging for attention or affection or anything. Like I’m doomed to feel alone even when surrounded by people who say they love me. I don’t want to live this way. I wish I could sleep forever. I have a class at 10 AM and it’s 5:35 AM right now. I wish I could sleep. I don’t want to sleep, though. I want to freeze time. It just keeps rushing by. I have so little time to recover, to take care of myself, to get rest. I know I’m going to be so tired tomorrow. It makes me want to take my life, that feeling. The feeling that even when I do everything I’m supposed to go the best of my ability, like “self care” and sleep and reaching out to people, I will always, always fall short and continue to be in pain. Why should I go to sleep if I will always wake up tired. Why not just end it all and, well,,, sleep forever. But I can’t. I’d hurt too many people. Including myself.

depression,"This is a long one. And thank you in advance to all who read the whole thing. 

I am a 20 y.o female living with my parents. Where I am from it is typical for the children to stay with their parents until married off. And in my family according to our religion and societal expectations I am supposed get married in 4 years or so. 

My situation is simple, really. I don’t want to get married. And no amount of convincing or begging is going to change their mind about that. My parents will not allow me to stay unmarried. Or live a independent life. It is also a matter of status for them. 

And the reason I don’t want to get married is that all I have seen is failed marriages. Plus I am supposed to follow along my parents wishes and marry a guy they find for me. I can’t do that. If I was a happy go lucky person with no worries in this world (and no dreams and aspirations might I add) then I might have been okay with the situation. But no. I want to be independent, not be trapped in some guy’s kitchen cooking and cleaning after him. 

Other part of the reason is I have severe depression and what else not diagnosed in my 3 visit to the psychiatrist. I can’t have a family, nor do I want to, to be honest. 

Honestly my parents are the reason for my depression. But fortunately they have changed. But for the longest time I couldn’t accept them. And recently I realized why. I can’t accept them because they won’t be able to accept me. The real me. The one who don’t want to get married. The one who just wants to be free and independent. I subconsciously knew it and that was what was hindering me from reconnecting with my parents.

And honestly, if this was how they were when I was growing up, I wouldn’t have had depression. 

All these things aside. I wanted a general opinion, or different perspective on if I should run away. (I should add, it is just a rhetorical question) Is it selfish of me to run off for my happiness and leave back the parents who raised me ? Or should I just shove all my feeling aside and just accept my fate as it comes and just get married ?",Is it selfish? Please comment your opinion on it.,Bleach_fan_914

depression,"In my short life. I’ve known nothing but instability. My parents cheated on one another. And have hated each other since I was little. They decided to stay together “because of me” so I wouldn’t have to grow up with divorced parents, but it just turned out to be worse. They made my life a living hell. Having both parents constantly trying to turn me against the other one. How does a teenager choose between the people that raised him? They finally separated in my freshman year of high school. But they kept the drama going and is still alive even now in my freshman year of college. When I took an interest in girls in middle school. It quickly became apparent they wanted nothing to do with me because they think I’m ugly. There hasn’t been a single one that hasn’t told me they think I’m ugly and trust me there’s been a lot. Now here I am. A depressed, broke, unstable, unloved teenage boy. No motivation to do school work and I failed my first semester of college. I lie to my parents who ask me every day if I’m keeping up with school. My rooms a mess, I’m gaining weight, I stay up all night staring at my phone. No matter what I do, I stay stagnant and unmotivated to do anything. I’ve lost friends to other colleges. My closest friends have changed and my other ones got girlfriends(who I introduced them to). 

I’m at the point now and I’ve been for the past few months where I simply do not want to exist anymore but I will never, ever lull myself or think about killing myself. I won’t ever be able to bring myself to do that.

I don’t see an outlet to this torment. I don’t want to exist in this cruel world anymore. Everybody is so mean to each other. Nobody loves each other anymore. Everybody is so concerned with their own agenda that they can’t focus on the good of other people. There is no good in the world anymore.

depression," 

I've realised too late in my youth what the world really is. It took me a long time to figure that out. And it took a lot of guts. I havent been happy for a very long time. But i now know that its not about being happy, but about being content. You''ll never reach happiness, so why bother? But you can be content with the way things are. And i believe thats the most important thing in life tbh.

This world isnt good. Its a bad place. If we view the world as a bad place, then every miserable thing that will happen to us will make us sad. Cause we are trying to be happy in world where its impossible. So youll try and be happy, but you wont be able to. And itll destroy your life.

But i have found a way to beat this. If you see the world as a bad place, full of suffering and torment, then youll always aim to be not sad, but just ok. Then youll always expect bad things to happen to you. But when a good thing happens to you. you'll be happy in that brief moment in time, and youll appreciate that happiness more without even striving towards it. Then youll go back to being content. And thats ok. Youll remember memories better than the average person, and those little moments where you feel happy.

so basically life isnt fair. it never was. and if we try to make it fair, we will lose everytime. so dont.

live for those little moments.

depression,"To preface, I have been struggling for years now, harking back to my childhood. I basically failed my A-levels and wanted to take some time off for myself, but no, I was given the ultimatum to either apply for university or find work. I got stuck into hard drugs (specifically GHB and amphetamine) 3 years ago and that really took a toll on my serotonin and dopamine, and I have been far worse off since stopping that and going to rehab last year. I was prescribed quetiapine and that’s done nothing but made me gain weight, completely numb me emotionally, made me lose ALL motivation for my hobbies, and basically made me not want to get out of bed.

This year has been really tough. Like *really* tough. I was off work most of this year and I lost my job at the end of July. So far I have had no luck in finding new employment. I had to stop looking two months ago because I just couldn’t do it. Everyone asks me if I’m doing okay and I just give the standard ‘yes’, because I don’t know what else to say.

I’ve been on and off drinking all year. Like 1-2 week binges with a 70cL bottle of vodka a day. It’s one of the only things that makes me feel okay. I have no friends whatsoever, and when I try to talk to people, they end up blanking me or flat out leaving. I’ve given up with that now. I don’t have anyone, and I don’t want to talk to people.

To top it all off, I got into contact with my GP about a medication change to sertraline to see if that can help. I’ve tried therapy/counselling and mental health courses. They do not work. I last heard from my GP and local mental health service about their considerations of changing my medication. That was on the 3rd of November. I’ve so far got into contact with my GP twice since then, and have heard absolutely nothing.

All I want is to feel okay, find another job, and be productive again. My room is a tip, my bed is covered in random things and rubbish. I can’t be bothered. I don’t care anymore.

I guess I’m just having a bad day today. I don’t want pity. I don’t want attention. I don’t want people to tell me that everything is going to be alright. I just want to let you all know that life is fucking shit and I honestly don’t see the point in going on. No, I’m not suicidal. No, I haven’t self harmed recently. I just want to get back into taking drugs because at least is something to make life feel worth it again. Not like I even know any dealers though, so that’s a dead avenue.

depression,"The time of the year that i am dreading the most is getting close and i do not know what to do...

A bit of my background.

As a kid i moved between countries a lot because of my parents' work and at first i loved it however I never managed to make any real friends...

When i turned 18 i came out to my family as gay, but no one accepted me, the environment was just too hostile to live in, being threatened every day was just so exhausting and i decided to leave my home and country and try to find happiness elsewhere, while keeping very little contact with my family.

 I am 26 now and in the last 7 years i moved quite a bit, for University, work, ex boyfriend etc, and last year i had to move back home in order to fulfill my national service in the army... unfortunately it still is obligatory and if i dont do it, i will have problems renewing my passport or re-entering the country. It was a horrible experience, because the army is just so homophobic and i had to hide who i am in order to keep my physical integrity...

The very next day of finishing the army, i started looking for a job outside my country, i got through many interviews and by July i actually got an amazing job offer in Barcelona/Spain. I did not hesitate at all, took it straight away and i moved to Barcelona in September. Now it's been just over 2 months that i am here, the current situation with Corona has not allowed me to make any friends at all, i have met people but i know none of them actually consider me a friend and everytime i messaged them and suggested to meet up for something, its always the same asnwer ""yeah sure, i will let you know"" and i can see on social media they go out a lot but never invite me... Even before Corona i found it hard to make friends... they just never seem interested enough to invite me for anything...

So....

All i do now is work from home and then either go for a walk or spend the rest of the day in my room watching Netflix or a little bit of gaming on my pc.

At first i loved going for walks as it helped me clear my head and exercise but now it only makes me feel worse, i go out and all i see is people in groups, friends, couples, families and i am walking between the crowds feeling like a shadow, like i don't exist. 

Sometimes the emotions become so hard to hold in so i will go somewhere isolated so people don't see me crying. 

Now we are less than a month away from Christmas and all i can see is my ""friends"" on Facebook and people that i have chatted to here in Barcelona making plans with friends and family and i know that i will be spending it completely alone. I share a flat with some other people, however 2 of them moved out last week and the last one is moving home for Christmas so i will be completely isolated for few weeks...

I wish i had someone who cares about me. Someone who wants to get to know me, a friend that i can talk to when i feel down, someone to tell me everything will be alright, someone to just give me a hug and let me feel some warmth because i don't remember the last time i felt loved or welcome anywhere.

I have been taking citalopram (20 mg) daily for about three years and I have tried to put them down in the past. At the moment, I am 4 days overdue for a dose because my tablets got lost in the post. 

The withdrawal from this medication is completely unbearable. I experience vertigo, severe low mood and extremely poor cognitive functioning (I can barely type this post). There is a chance that I will never be free from these things as I cannot bear the withdrawal process. I reckon I would literally need at least three months to fully recover from the withdrawal symptoms. 

My doctor told me that there is no withdrawal and you can stop taking them when you wish. This is misleading and dangerous information. Please, for your sake, do not take these things. I strongly urge other options like cognitive behavioural therapy, counselling or even controlled use of psychedlics in a therapeutical setting (this has become a prominant field of research that needs more attention, seriously). 

Whilst my medication did help for a couple of months, they no longer help me. I'm now essentially addicted to them as the withdrawal pains are so pronounced and unbearable. I do not want to see other people go down this black hole.

- drugs (i used over 30 different substances, some of them were a habit, including benzodiapenines and opiates)
- stealing (i went stealing stuff from stores when i felt bad, sometimes little, sometimes large things. i got pretty good at it, until i got caught over a stolen nuisance, and never triedagain)
- video games (i was horribly addicted to them at one point)
- exercise (after my time of obesity, i started doing sports everyday, working out often until i almost passed out over months. when i could not exercise due to injury i felt useless and depressed)

so ive tried all of these, and now its covid, and i think i found a new, very toxic way to cope: tinder. seriously, this is so toxic, i have a hard time writing about it. the secret to not being afraid of rejection, of not having to wait for texts, is to have an entire queu of girls who are waiting to text to you. its fun, its real fun, but i noticed recently how obsessed i've become with it. if i would have to stop today, there would be nothing left, i am already feeling like shit most of the time, without tinder, without the women i text and meet, there would be nothing left.

i know that this is toxic, wrong, and i should probably be ashamed of what i am doing. but returning to drugs is not an option, it is too cold to exercise outside and i am injured, stealing is not an option aswell as i do have a record, and i will never return to gaming.

depression,"Idk why but I think I really need therapy, ever since I was a kid i was always lonely and it was mostly because of family issues that made me isolated from everyone else. My parents always fought and eventually the unfortunate happened and I tried to make myself stronger by being resilient but I just ended up making a huge gap in my life. I've never felt cared or Its more like 'i could never feel what's it's like to be cared for' and if I do my mind goes in a frenzy like it's my first time being cared for. So If a person really gets close with me or If I feel that they're close with me Im so inclined to just be with them cause of my lonliness that Ive felt for all of these years 

I tell people about this and they say the lonliness is temporary but it isn't; it's never been temporary it's always been here for my whole life and the shitty part is I can never do anything about it. The need for people (ik this is getting dramatic,but I just feel like I saying it) is like my new form of happiness; it's pathetic and I feel disgusted but I just don't know what else can make me happy.Being this lonely just made want people so much that I don't require anything else and it's just I'm dying in the inside everytime someone leaves or is gone for even like a second. One solution is make new friend or grow your circle but I'm afraid I'm just gonna fuck up things for others.

I feel toxic and I feel like an ass, people have their lives and who am I to interfere? Who am I to expect people to be there for me?

depression,"At the point that I'm at, my two choices are either to open up about my feelings, tell someone about how bad I feel constantly, or to shove it all down like I usually do. 

In option 1, I open up to someone, tell them I want to die, and what happens? They cry, they blame themselves, they walk on eggshells around you for months, and you have to work extremely hard to put up a façade of happiness so that they can be ok. Nothing good can come of it, at least in my position, because I don't have anybody that truly cares or that can put my emotional stability before theirs for even an instant. It's not their fault, I can't expect anybody to care about me when I can't care about myself, can I? at this point I'm not very capable of loving people anymore, and so the reward to anybody who tries to help of strengthening a relationship is not available.

In option 2, I repress the bad feelings with escapist media and drugs like I usually do, but that is obviously even worse for me. In the short term, however, I am able to function somewhat normally, and I can spare people around me from the potentially immense burden of giving a shit about my emotional stability. Long term, however, this strategy probably leads to a suicide attempt, which if discovered could hurt the people around me even worse than if I opened up to them in the first place. 

It really is a shitty situation to be in. either way, at some point I am going to selfishly inflict pain on people around me, and tbh I'm not worth the effort most of the time. like so many aspects of depression, I am trapped on a road with daunting prospects at every possible turn.

I graduated in June 2019, I started working at Burger King before I graduated so I would have something to do afterwards. It was shit conditions, so much stress and  not getting payed well, but it was at least a job. I managed to find another job at a call centre as tech support for one of the biggest TV companies in Sweden. This job was also shit but better than Burger King. But I didn't want to go to work, I would go to the toilet and wish for the time to go faster. Customers would call us idiots, yell at us and call us all the names in the book. On top of that we had a lot of pressure from our boss. No call should be longer than 10 minutes, during that time you hade to register the ticket while talking to the customer and we had to sell them things aswell. No matter how well we did we could always do better. Once again I have a new job which is amazing. But I feel like the stress from this and last year is taking its toll on me. I haven't been unemployed since I left school and I haven't had more than 3 days off at the same time (besides some weekends) and I'm losing my mind.

depression,"I'm almost 25 and it has become clear to me that I want to end my life.

When I was around 15, it became clear I wanted a university degree. I was an underachiever in school and my mother kept pushing me to drop out of school. She would scream and insult me when I resist. But I kept fighting back to stay in school, often involving counsellors to defend me because I felt I wouldn't be listened to if I spoke myself.

I didn't meet the requirements for university. My mother pushed me into a graphic design course I did for 6 months, then I pushed back into a university preparation course, then she pushed me into an arts degree after I completed the university preparation course, I did that for a year even though I didn't want to, then pushed back and started a Computer Science degree.

As you can see, there was no clear plan. Just two different conflicting ideals. But sadly for her, it is my life so she can fuck off and stop controlling it.

I did a year of a Computer Science degree. I consider going to university and doing a degree of my own choice the proudest thing I've ever been proud of -- because my mother made it her mission to make sure it doesn't happen. Yelling at me to give up and forget it.

The process of staying in school and going to university was a hurtful and intense experience which redefined what I want out of life, and my parent's roles in my life. It didn't happen once; it happened every year from 15 onwards until I no longer needed to rely on them. My sister believes my mother did nothing wrong and believes I'm just blaming her -- I believe she's just too blindly loyal to see any wrongdoing in my mother's behaviour.

After a year of my degree, I fell into deep depression and left university for 2 years. One year I was on the welfare, the next year I worked at a supermarket (grocery store). They didn't appreciate me there. I was honest about my struggles with mental health early on, and had issues with talking to myself in the isle. It was a tough experience.

After that, I quit and came back to university.

I have an ongoing backward-thinking habit. I don't know where it comes from, but it has existed for my whole adult life. I continually think about people, places, and memories from my past, and feel a frequent urge to search them up online to see how they are now. I feel regret at hurting others and smile at the nicer memories. I still think about YouTube personalities I used to watch at about 10 years ago who haven't uploaded videos for years.

I've seeked out EMDR because I believed it was trauma. But now I'm not sure. I don't know why I continually live in the past, but I believe it is a lifelong habit I'm stuck with.

Now I'm almost 25 in a week. I've seen many of my peers in the 4 different courses at 3 different institutions I've done graduate, I'm watching peers from high school and university have babies and get married. Every day I'm just reminded of how far away my high school years ago, and watch as peers keep moving ahead with their lives.

Even if I do graduate and get a degree, so what? I'm still going to keep looking backwards forever.

I've decided I don't want children because the inability to move on from past experiences isn't practical.

I've also had a lot of fun in my youth and it seems from here, it gets a whole lot more boring.

depression,"I am quite the pathetic person, I have failed at everything I ever tried to accomplish. Everything that I do is done with such little skill and grace that its honestly an afront to society.

Every now and then I will self harm, because in my mind I see it as a way to enact justice when no one else will. No one punishes me for my failures and incompetence so I must do it myself. I will do this in regard to any failure as long as it isn't inconvient for someone else. For example when playing videos games and doing poorly I'll make sure to either physically abuse myself or emotionally abuse myself with insults about my pathetic nature, or how I would be better off dead. I know this is hard to understand for most people, my friends usually respond with phrases such as ""its only a game"" or ""why play a game if you don't have fun."" The problem is that its not just a game its a reflection of myself and my worth. If I can't do well in a something that's just a game even when I try doesn't that show that I can't do well in anything? Games are made to be completed or done well in, yet I can't do it. To me it seems like everyone has something they are good at, the problem is that I don't. Moving on from video games I tried to learn how to draw but couldn't, even with the extra motivation to do well in order to avoid physical abuse I just couldn't do well.

I have already made the conclusion that I will die by suicide one day, but should that date be pushed closer to the present to avoid polluting the world with my stench? I just don't know, google doesn't really have any answers to questions about how much self hatred, and self harm is required in order to balance out the bad aspects of myself so I came here.

depression,"I'm 16, and I've had Depression for about 2 yrs now. It's been an absolute shithole everyday, but by now I'm pretty much used to it. Only thing is, is that for a couple of months now. I started to feel much less creative, and Intelligent. Like I said I'm used to it by now. Feeling extremely depressed, getting stressed out very easily, and doubting myself all the time. But when I started feeling less intelligent, I felt like I took a bullet to the chest. As I love solving mental puzzles, and theorizing ideas about the universe(Logical Reasoning, Lateral Thinking, Abstract Reasoning, thought experiments, etc). And I wanted to become Theoretical Physicist, or an Astronomer. Those were my hobbies, along with gaming...I don't really have many friends as you can probably tell lol. Oddly enough, I didn't pick up the puzzles hobby until I just started feeling depressed a couple years back. I didn't share my hobbies with anyone though, as I didn't want to. Because I felt so different from everyone else, that no one understood me, so it was extremely hard for me to relate to them. But that's why I have different personalities for each friend lol. It always gave me satisfaction when doing things like these, and that was enough to keep me going. But now I'm feeling Way less motivated to solve anything because when I do I feel like a Absolute Idiot, gaming barely entertains me anymore, and I'm starting to get really scared now. Because Intelligence &amp; Creativity, were my skills. If I didn't have them. then who would I be. They weren't always though, as in middle school &amp; kindergarten my parents were told I had some sort of learning disability, and apparently something called ""Fine Motor Delay"" in my hands. So in middle school, anything, or any classes my teachers didn't think I could handle/do, I taken out of. I didn't know this back then though. I have more control over my classes in High School though, luckily. So School was hell for me then, and it is NOW. I still don't understand a single thing they're trying to teach me, which makes me worry for my career, since my grades are JUST above average.

depression,"I'm 26, Male and i have a story to tell.
I'm writing this on 11-30-20. My birthday
Yay happy b-day to me....
Life honestly doesn't feel the same anymore and im getting closer to that numb feeling I've heard alot about. I've been a trooper my whole life. I always kept my chin up with a smile. Maybe people just wanted to see me break down?

Heres a back story about myself before i jump into why you clicked on this.

Lifes been pretty shitty. I've had my up's and great times but most of my life has been nothing but hard times. 
My grandfather owned a business and my dad worked for him. 
So you could say i lived the middle class life growing up. 
We weren't rich but my parents always treated us to stuff when we deserved it.
My problems aren't financial related.

I didn't have many friends.  
Throughout my life i maybe had 10 friends? 
It doesn't matter now because as it stands right now i only have 2 friends. 
I was bullied from the 2nd grade -7th grade. 
I was just a target to alot of kids. 
One day in the 5th grade my older brother passed away from a heart condition that runs in the family. 
Its called prolonged qt syndrome just incase you were curious.

My teacher obviously found out and she had the whole class write me ""feel better"" cards they made from the classes art supplies but my bully was also in that class. 
I'll never forget what that bully said to me the day after my brothers funeral.
He laughed at me and said ""Your brothers dead"".
I mentally snapped and blacked out.
I only remember being pulled off him by the teacher.
I was punished for it ultimately while he got away scott free because his friends lied for him.

One day in the 7th grade, i finally had enough and snapped on one of the guys who wouldn't leave me alone.
 He was walking behind me and slapped me in the back of the head for no reason at all. 
At that very moment, i already had the thought of ""I've had enough of people's shit"" running through my mind.
 Not in the school shooter type of way, but in a way i would finally stand up for myself against people who made me a target. 
So when he hit me i just let loose. 

I ended up breaking his ankle. 
He was heavy set guy. 
I'd say he was 5'4 and 320 pound easy.
i stepped on his foot with all my weight and pushed him sideways. 
Well, that landed me in hot water obviously.
 I got in way more trouble than him even though i was fighting back against a bully who did nothing but mentally and physically abuse me. 
He got to stay in school and they put me in a Behavioral Disorder school or ""BD school"" as most call it.  
I ended up dropping out my sophomore year because i was just done with life and everyones shit.

The fact that i was in trouble for doing the right thing for myself created one hell of a ride for me in the future and I'm at equal fault for the results these experiences yielded. 
I could have handled things better in life.

(So now that you have some what of a bio of myself, let me get to major points)

Around late 2011, early 2012 i ended up in my first relationship surprisingly.
 She treated me with respect, love and everything else a healthy relationship brings to the table. 
I found this to be odd at first because of how negative people have been to me.
 I grew used to this and thats where i fucked up. 
I let my guard down completely and told her why i felt misunderstood my whole life. 

I felt misunderstood because no matter what i did to defend myself or to please others i always got looked at like i did something wrong. 
Not just by my peers, but also people my age.
I felt like a total outcast my whole life.
The relationship only lasted a little under 2 years. Towards the end of that relationship i was going through another rough patch.

I found out she was cheating on me. 
I was angry, upset and didn't know why she would do that to me. 
I initially exploded verbally towards her. I could have handled myself better thinking about it now but what she did next is just cold.

I begged for her back, pleaded and poured my heart out to her over the phone. 
She laughed and handed the phone to her new toy.
(I only say new toy because she was with him for like 2 weeks lol)
The guy she was cheating with was sending me voice clips on messenger. 
I knew him, he was a Friend of a friend and i was at his house a couple times. 
Most of them consisted of him gloating about how he stole my girlfriend. 

I got to a boiling point, snapped again and went to his house without warning.
Instead of banging on the door, i kicked it repeatedly.
After the first few kicks he opens the door and i shove him back inside so i can close the door behind me. 
This way nobody could see what i was about to do to this guy.

 I beat the ever living shit out of him.
He never called the police on me either surprisingly. 
My ex made me out to be this psychopath after that but 
She was just mad that i beat up her new boyfriend.
He really did ask for it in my opinion.
the rumors she spread were pretty serious because they effect me till this day. 
She claimed without a single mark on her body to prove it, that i had beat her after i beat up the boyfriend.

I still had most of my friends. 
Me and my ex were in the same small circle so it made it a bit more tough for all of us to hang out as a group after that. They knew i only beat the shit out of him.


We skip forward to 2018 and it brings us to a similar story about another ex. The relationship starts out great, she cheats and ofcourse i wanted her back.
( im hopeless i know)
We got back together and this was just a bad idea because it just became toxic after that.
 I was no longer happy but she didn't want me to leave her.  

She went full blown psychotic and started hitting, scratching and bitting herself. I was genuinely freaked the hell out and physically picked her up and put her outside.  
Her sister came and got her and when she did i quickly put her stuff outside my front door so she couldn't get back in. 
Can you guys guess whats coming next?
She claimed i beat her and her sister not only believed her but spread it around town.

This was hit of epic proportions to my reputation because not only was my last ex part of our circle, this one was too and they both now claimed that i beat them and both of these rumors spread like wildfire after the 2nd one. 
We skip to 2020 and all of my friends are gone except for 2. 
All of them just blocked me at random times and never said a word.
Like 10+ years meant nothing.

My grandpa died from a medical procedure this year too. 
We hung out everyday. 
I would get off work about 3pm and go to his store and on my days off i would go spend time with him.
We would always talk about stuff that was on our mind.
He knew what i was going through and he was there with me every step of the way.
Now that my grandpa is gone i can feel the need to go with him becoming stronger.
It feels like life just takes what little i have left and makes it dissappear and for what? I didn't do much wrong in my life
But thats just how the cookie crumbles.

The moral of the story is don't say false things about people. It can hurt them in more ways than you realize.

I can't save myself anymore and i know how this going to end for me but maybe it will get the message out there to help stop this from happening to others....

 All that did was make me feel bad for struggling so hard to live life on a normal schedule, if I was able to do it at all. I'd be doing okay for a few days and then I'd have an episode and stay up until 7am and feel horrible or not brush my teeth floor a couple days because I couldn't make myself get up to do it before bed.

As of the last month or so it’s just became more than I can handle.

Once I came back I worked out a schedule I somewhat felt comfortable with, I worked the day I was scheduled earlier this week and tonight I was also scheduled. But the past two days I’ve been off I have been in such a rut, I can’t do anything, I can’t eat, I can’t drink anything, I can’t get up, I can’t communicate with anyone, I haven’t even been able to simply stand up in the shower the past few weeks, my motivation is just gone, I feel absolutely useless and helpless.

So, early this morning I messaged my boss and said that I’ve been struggling and that I would do my best to be good for my evening shift.

They mentioned that they can’t keep me if they never know when I’m working, which I completely understand, but that really hasn’t been happening.

Even before I would take extra shifts and cover for someone if anyone ever called out on my days off, so it was easier for them.

I’ve been a lot more irritable, moody and tired since then. That in combination with people generally being assholes in the world, I stopped going out much unless is absolutely necessary.

It doesn’t make me feel any better knowing these things, it just lets me know that before and while I was going through what I was going through, these things also occurred. Other things happened. 

Here it is, 2020. 2020 happened and I’m still trying to cope with what happened to me in 2017. I’ve been personally affected by this year and all I have to say is that it accelerated my already ongoing decline into the abyss. I do the bare minimum of hygiene and bathe. At least I can still push myself to do that. I’m just so tired. I’m done trying to human. Why can’t I just be a tree in a forest somewhere? I contemplated going back to school but its so hard to concentrate most days and I already know how I won’t attend class regularly. Not to mention my horrible retention skills. I can’t remember anything, especially not material from a book. I used to enjoy reading books but now my mind wonders too much, unable to grasp what I’m reading, causing me to read a sentence over and over again. Its honestly frustrating. 

I am not suicidal but I do write my own stories involving me going to a remote area, getting killed by something/someone in a romantic sort of way, if that makes any sense to anyone other than my depressed brain. Call it suicidal fantasy. 
I have no problem reading and comprehending what I write oddly enough, so I write often. At least I can enjoy something other than sleep.

I’m a runner. I ran to college, then I ran even further, overseas. I’ve traveled all around the world. I’ve lived in 4 countries. I worked so so hard to get where I am now, a small island in SE Asia because I fell in love with it 5 years ago, but sometimes when you get to your biggest dreams, you realize it’s not at all what you want. I live with my boyfriend, who is a native of the island. He’s just an asshole. We rarely even talk. He’s unemployed and I really think I’m being used for money. I spend at least 98% of my week alone inside my home as I also work from home. There aren’t many expats here and the depression spell I’ve been in the past few years is so much different than anything I’ve had before.

I have periods where I feel ok-ish I think, like right before switching universities for example, because it was needed and I was outside alot then and being ok I guess.

I'm kinda scared to go seek help and they just say; you're just overexegerating or smth, idk why I think that. Because idk if I really have it bad, idk when I have it that bad, that I need to search help I guess?

depression,"Hello. I'm in my early twenties and I am a beginner programmer. About a month ago I received a job offer to join a new startup company as a junior programmer.

They said that I'll start there as a temp for a probationary period and based on my work they'll decide if I'll be signing for a permanent position with them. The job is a remote job, and the offered payment is okay. The managers are nice and thoughtful. Overall it's a job with good terms.

But, the issue here is not on the company side, it is me. I am diagnosed with Schizophrenia and Social Anxiety Disorder. That affects my work in multiple levels.

For example, I am getting stressful in meetings and I often try to avoid them in the first place. When I do attend meetings, I don't talk. Or, when I get tasked to do something, and there's a very tight deadline, I start to get panicked and stressed about not being able to make it.

So I'm thinking about leaving this job. When I talked to my family about this, they said that because of the good terms, I should keep it, suck it up and adapt. They say that it is a good starting point for my career. And I agree with them, and I know that if I leave this job, I probably won't be able to find something with as good terms as this. And that I won't be able to save money for later in my life. But on the other hand, as I said, I don't feel good with myself. I get stressed and anxious.

I do love the line of job that I chose, when I work on my own projects in my own terms, I am more calm and relaxed.

So this is where I am stuck now. On one hand, I'm scared of staying, because this condition might get worse, and it may be too late to leave, and it may come to a point where I'm sick of this job I won't want to do anything related to it anymore, but on the other hand, I don't know if there's anything better for me right now.

I brought up couples therapy once when I couldn't put my mental aside, and couldn't adequately take care of him because of it. He's not fond on that idea. I think it would be a good way for us to help each other, especially since both of us are no longer on medication.

depression,"A part of me has accepted that this is who I am, but a part of me would like to be emotional in a sense? 

For example, my grandad passed away recently and instead of me going to the funeral to say goodbyes and mourn like others, I wanted to go to the funeral to wear a suit and look fancy. 

Last time I fully cried was when I lived in an abusive household. 5 years ago. I’ve shed tears and even learned to fake cry, but never a full on outburst of tears. 

I can’t remember the last time I felt stressed or sad. My mum went to a different country and I’m all alone now and I don’t feel sad about having no family here. I don’t miss her... I don’t miss anybody. Hell even when I broke up with my partner of two years I felt happy and free rather than sad. 

Even when my job gets very busy, I don’t feel a single bit stressed. I don’t really understand what stress feels like. When I lay in bed and think of a ‘stressful’ situation I laugh? When my calendar is full of meetings and deadlines I have the capacity to complete them and to understand how important they are, but a part of me is more than capable of ignoring them and lying to my boss and pretending like I simply forgot. 

I have learned to fake sympathy and empathy for others, such as when a family member passes away, but I just cannot feel it... I have tried it very very hard, dedicated weeks to studying empathy and still cannot feel an ounce of others pain. This sucks because I want to be a counsellor or a life coach.. 

I enjoy things and get very ecstatic, happy and even angry so it is not that I’m unable to feel? It is simply that I would like to experience a wider range of emotions... I would like to feel stress, others pain, feel bad for others or just to know what it’s like to be sad? 

I am currently on medication for depression and have noticed pure ‘ecstasy’ every now and then, just a massive surge of energy and happiness and pleasure which makes me feel invincible... But I kind of want to experience the sad parts too.","I’m not sure how to describe it, but I don’t react to anything in an emotional way...?",JiggaJiggaMuffMuff
depression,"A lot has happened in 2020, as we all know too well. It's been a shit year. 

To add to this: My grandmother is dying and its heartbreaking to watch my family be so distressed. I have friends who need some time away from me due to me taking my anxieties out on them when we lived together. I feel terrible and very guilty for hurting my friends when I did not realise I was doing this. I got into a relationship that I was so happy in, only to be broken up with later in the year. All solidify the thoughts in my mind that I'm a horrible mess of a person that nobody wants to be around. 

My friends are all kinda growing up &amp; apart - we don't see eachother much anymore, even out of lockdown &amp; pandemic - relationships getting more serious, friends moving abroad, spending more time with their partners and on their own careers and lives. I understand it, but it doesn't make things easier. I can tell that they are tired of hearing my problems. I feel alone, unwanted and like people are sick of my shit. I apologise to people for even saying a sentence sometimes. 

Anxiety &amp; depression have been on and off in my life like a high school couple for the last nine years, but never as strong as this. I am 28 now. I feel like I've achieved nothing. I went back to university at 23, graduated a year ago and am now doing a masters on top of my job. I can't do it. I can't even motivate myself to sit and do research. I've been to talk therapy, cbt and on meds over and over. I always think they work at the time, but then realise that I never really learnt much as I struggle with myself over and over. I've tried the meditation, the journaling. 

I'm waking up each day since the break-up with a knot in my stomach and a beating chest. It was really the straw that broke the camel's back. I realise that i's not him I miss or I crave, but that it really just compounded all of my feelings of worthlessness. I cry too much. I lie on my bed with a blanket over me watching crap shows when I knew I should be working and researching for college work, then I feel intense guilt for not being able to do it. I can't stop eating, then sometimes my stomach growls at me but I can't bring myself to get up and cook. I am not interested in anything anymore. I have motivation for life and I hate this. I just want to be normal again. 

I am in the middle of over-the-phone counselling, but it's not working. What type of therapy worked for people here who have experienced these type of feelings?

depression,"So a few things for background: My boyfriend and I have been together for a year and a half and we live together. He’s had issues with depression since childhood and has been diagnosed with major depression. He IS getting help. 

A few times a year he has very serious depressive episodes, during which he can barely function. These can last from a week to a month. This is made harder by the fact that he works 60-hour weeks doing manual labor at a factory. When he gets home from work during one of these episodes he either goes to sleep immediately or will watch the same movie over and over. If I cook something and put it on a plate and bring it to him he’ll eat it, but if I don’t literally put food in front of him he won’t eat. 

I genuinely don’t mind helping him when he’s having an episode. From my perspective he is sick, and you take care of your loved ones when they’re sick. 

But one thing I haven’t been able to find a way to help him with is basic hygiene. He’ll rarely shower, or brush his teeth during his depressive spells. And these are things that I can’t take on for him while he’s struggling. Have any of you guys had success with maintaining basic hygiene while in an episode?

depression,"I've been struggling with depression on-and-off for several years. The latest period had its roots pre-covid but since covid started, it got real bad. I know that for some people depression feels like emptiness and a loss of sensation, but for me it's often the opposite. I feel so overwhelmed by feelings and thoughts that I can't function anymore. It's like a constant storm in my mind, trying to figure out what the hell is going on with me and it's exhausting. In the past few weeks I've had my heart broken and felt lonelier than usual, and often I'd just lie in bed, crying and feeling like shit. Not gonna detail the stuff that happened in the couple of days leading up to this, cause it's a lot, but this Wednesday, I had a sudden urge to go out for a run. I don't normally do it, but I felt like I really needed to get out of the house for a bit and let out some energy. I'm a bad athlete, but somehow I managed to run for way longer than I usually do. I live by the beach, so naturally I took a route that overlooks the ocean, and I was just struck by how peaceful everything is. I sat on a bunch of rocks right by the sea, and it seemed weirdly different this time. It seemed solid, and it made me calm. I continued to sit there for like 30 minutes, just appreciating the moment of peace I was in. It felt like everything was going to be fine, and like I could do anything. There were even tears of joy in my eye. I'm not new to crying, but I almost never cry tears of joy. I knew it's not gonna last, and sure enough a couple hours later I was in bed again and barely functioning, but I think that one moment shows that maybe I have it in me to make it out of depression.","I felt one moment of peace this week, for the first time in a long while",orko1995

depression,"I can't remember being stable or feeling unprovoked happiness, but for most of my childhood I had hobbies and passions to keep me occupied, until senior year of high school. I remember a swift change happening in my personality over the course of just a couple weeks. I kinda lost all my fight and barely graduated.

I spent a couple years at a community college a few miles down the road, working on a music degree and generally just doing the bare minimum to survive. It was shortly before I dropped out in 2018 that I finally told my doctor something felt wrong psychologically.

2 years, 4 therapists, and countless med switches later, I've found that depression is the least of my worries. I spent the longest time thinking it was normal to need some time to cry every day. After all of this treatment my breakdowns are no less common and I've pushed several friends and loved ones to their limits... and honestly, I'm surprised that I'm still here after a quarter-century of either struggling to live every day, or wishing I didn't have to.

In 2020 I've faced the horror of the only employer I've stayed with for any long term teetering on the brink of collapse since they can't operate during the pandemic. I've come to terms with the prospect of there not even being peace where I live by the time business as usual can resume. It's been since New Year's Day that I've even had a fuckin hug, man. I've resisted the urge to cope in any dangerous or unlawful ways, but I feel just as far gone as the people in my community that have OD'd in the last few years. I try to take some of the edge of with some hard cider, but I can't bring myself to get drunk enough to feel happy; alcohol took someone important from me and I don't want to go out that way.

Truth be told, I don't know what convinced me to type this all out. I suppose it's a damn pity party, at least in part. I suppose what I'm trying to say with all of this is... sometimes, it really is too late for someone to save themselves, and some tunnels don't come out the other side. But even if I'm miserable every single day for another 40 or 50 years, I'm gonna face it, because part of my horrible mental health comes from the trauma of losing someone because they drowned in their struggles.

depression,"  I don’t even know if I’m alive on the inside anymore, it all feels hollow, as if I’m nothing but a mechanical jitter-jatter who’s just ordered around by everyone all the time. It started after my sister was born, she’s 7 years younger than me and I’m an 18 y.o guy right now (legally 17). It was all good a few years ago, when just I was there. My parents and I were happy together, I was an obedient kid, studied studiously,did whatever they wanted me to do and when my sister was born I was the kid most happy about it, I would rock her until she fell asleep,sing lullabies, life couldn’t have been better. But things started to change, as she grew up,the “happy family” image started to flicker and disappear at times in my head, eventually my parents started to groan,shout at me for no whatsoever of reason. Generally it was for my grades although I was still the studious kid in class, they thrashed me when I, a 6th/7th grade had maybe slight difficulties with a math problem. They’d with time somehow altered their description of me from “our son” to “an investment who’s going to get us grades in return”. By the time I was a teenager I already had second thoughts if I could even ask them for help or advice if I needed it, I was too afraid that they’d either thrash me or remind me of my worthlessness. By the time I reached 10th grade I started hiding things solely out of fear from them, even when I clearly said that I wanted to be frank with them about some things, they thought I was answering back and being disrespectful. Everyone has those slipping and rising points in life, I was no exception. This was the time my matriculate exams were near and my pre-matriculate exams were only a week ahead. It was that very week that I got into an argument with my best friend and she stopped talking to me, she’d always made me feel better about myself and now she behaved around me as if I didn’t even exist. I started to get anxious, all I had now were just nightmares, sometimes panic attacks and breathlessness,I couldn’t even focus on my studies properly because of this. Eventually the effect started to show on my grades and sleep schedule too, I got deep dark circles around my eyes, I started crying myself out every night.  I couldn’t reach out much to other people because I’m not really a person with a lot of friends. Again, my parents assumed that I was just being lazy and was trying to find excuses for scoring an 85% on my pre-matriculations. It was then that I started having suicidal thoughts. My best friend had left me, my own parents never tried to ask me how I was (instead they spent their whole time pampering my sister and listening to her every need). I thought that this would change if I got my shit together, I cried myself out for one last time (for which my parents thought that I was just doing some emotional melodrama). I started studying hard, writing 40-50 pages each day until my hands hurt, kept practicing problems until I couldn’t keep my eyes open anymore, the result? I got a 95.6% in my matriculation exams and it was all good for just one day. As I moved on into the next class, the “you’ve done well son” changed to “you could’ve done better if you would’ve listened to me” to “you couldn’t have done anything if we hadn’t thrashed you” and finally to “you’re worthless, without us forcing you to do things,without someone there to thrash you,you’re nothing”. I started feeling worthless but somehow I managed to have a decent year at my prep school for my medical entrances and an 85% at school, they weren’t happy. It was in my 11th year at school that I secured a junior internship at the Kennedy Space Centre, NASA, Florida, for the first time after so long, I had some confidence in myself but it didn’t last long. Although they praised me for it in front of everyone else, relatives to colleagues but it all changed when nobody was around to the same “you’re useless” and “you are nothing without us forcing you to do things and our advice”. Somehow even with all that negative burden and all then times I had to plead to them to let me go for the internship, I managed to get through but after I got back all I ever got to hear from them was “ You just used this internship as an excuse to get away from studies, what a worthless,lazy kid we’ve got here”. Somehow the year passed and I got into my final year at school, this was supposed to be a crucial year for me since I had my medical school entrance exams coming as well. Despite all the negatives and burdens I was enthusiastic about it, partly because my decent performance at my prep school had helped keep my confidence up for this one particular goal and partly because I planned to try and become financially independent of them this year but it was went down the chute. The pandemic happened,then a nationwide lockdown,and whenever I tried to apply for another job or internship, I kept getting reminded that I was worthless and could do nothing in life. Eventually I started experiencing very frequent burn-outs that lasted for around a month, my grades plummeted for the first half of the semester and it didn’t really add to my already bad situation at home. By now,nobody had asked me “how I felt, was I happy? Was I upset? What could they do to life my spirits up? “  since the last few years, All it mattered now for everyone was my grades, it was like their son was dead, only the grade-getting machine inside him was kept alive, it had been so worse by now that I was numb to almost everything, happiness,sadness,it all felt empty the same way. I didn’t want to laugh anymore, I didn’t want to cry anymore, eventually I also lost contact with a few other friends I had.

But things flipped for a while when I came into contact with a girl I met online. We became friends, we started talking a lot and for the first time in months, I started smiling even when there was no reason to, sometimes blushing as well at something she said. We started sharing our problems with each other, writing poetry for each other. For the first time in many months I felt happy and a little enthusiasm came back into my life, what had been a dark room before now seemed like a road, a road with her as a little streak of sunshine falling on the way ahead, a road that now I was hopeful about.

I started studying with passionately, the emptiness and the feel of being worthless was slowly fading away but it did not last long. Eventually my parents found out the reason for the little glee I had and decided that it needed to be dead. I was given a long lecture in a firm punishing tone on how having a friend in my final year would be too distracting for me and I was again going towards the path of worthlessness. Somehow it felt like God hadn’t listened tome all these years crying but seemed to listen to them. She ghosted, it all happened just suddenly one day that it was too much for me to take in, for 2 months we’d been together, and then suddenly she stopped talking to me. At first I thought she’d just been busy and hence couldn’t talk but eventually all became clear when a few months passed, it was either she didn’t want to talk to me anymore or she wanted to but couldn’t for some reason anymore. I tried engaging myself by applying for a part-time job to take my mind of her and stay away from my parents as long as I could but they threatened me to pull out my application, which I complied with to avoid getting kicked out of the house. I wanted to cry but somehow the tears didn’t come out anymore. Since I was not a kid anymore, the thrashing had stopped but it was just replaced by more and more reminding me of how worthless I am. 

It’s been 3 months since then and I’ve already had a few burnouts, it’s like nothing seems interesting and enjoyable anymore, I don’t talk to any of my friends (although I hardly have any), I almost get reminded every other day how useless I am and how I’m going to do nothing in life (by doing nothing in life they mean I’m not capable enough to be a doctor, anything other than a doctor or an engineer is a waste of life as per them) and I have suicidal thoughts almost every night although I still get 85-95% scores on all my tests, they never acknowledge it. Whenever a success, it’s somehow because of them pushing me around and whenever a failure or a bad grade (even an average one),it’s my own fault alone, not theirs and my only friend ghosting me just adds to the pain. I can’t confront them because I’ll get thrashed/threatened and scolded to the point I end up having panic attacks and when we do have maybe a good and happy moment, they just make me feel like the wisest thing I could ever do would be to hand over the reins of my life in their hands for the next 50 years which makes me feel even more depressed and anxious to have those sad moments back because even if I fail, at least I’d be free to take my own decisions. It was my 18th b’day a few months ago and I still didn’t get spared, they just kept reminding me how worthless I was when I asked if I could just take a break and rest that day. I spent the rest of the day crying in my room.

By now I also feel like this has affected the deepest of my passions, to be a doctor, all of it feels empty, studying for my premeds doesn’t excite me anymore and that just invites more taunts  and comments on my worthless from them, all this while my 10 year old sister’s opinions get valued and heard over mine in the house as if she’s some pool of eternal wisdom while whatever I say gets dismissed as useless  and not worth listening to. I don’t even feel alive on the inside anymore, I just feel empty. I feel like crying to my situation but the tears don’t come out anymore, it’s all numb to me. I want to just end it,it’d be a whole lot easier but sometimes I just wonder what if she,the one who made me happy for a while comes back and then when the feeling of killing my self becomes stronger, I’m still afraid to die. I don’t know what to do with this life anymore. I’ve already lost my so called family and as time passes I’m losing out on my career,my goals, my friends and all the hope I had.

**I will say now that I have no problem being part of her support system.** This isn't a daily (or even weekly) thing so it's not debilitating at all.

I once asked if she'd like help finding free online counseling. She didn't think it would help. She also says simply being able to unreservedly voice how she's feeling helps the logical part of her brain take back control and stops her.

She'd done therapy in the past and said it was helpful. Considering that, I'm taking her word for it that this would be somehow different.

Last night, she texted me on the floor crying and fighting the urge to self-harm, and went to bed laughing and loving herself and everything she has.

depression,"So I don't really post on reddit a lot, but I thought I'd give this a shot because I think I've just needed to write this stuff out and maybe have somebody listen or read, and maybe get some insight or opinions on where to go from here.

To give a little backstory and perspective:

I'm a 20 year old guy and I got diagnosed by a counselor when I was 16 with chronic depression and extreme generalized anxiety, and she speculated that this was something I'd been suffering from for a few years prior.
This I've deduced myself more recently was to due with the events that happened when I was 13, my dad left my mom. Which I know is such a typical thing that happens to young children and is often a source of grief, and even back then I actually handled the initial split really well. But I found out some of the reasons why as months passed. But there was a period of time after the initial split for about a year to a year and a half where I didn't really see my father and when I did he was so checked out it didn't really matter anyways, after about 6 months I had started to realize why. My mother had abused my father, emotionally, mentally and I learned sometimes physically. Telling him things like ""your a waste of space"" pretty regularly, but I think he'd hidden that for most of me and my sisters lives from us. Though she treated him this way she was still heart broken when he left, due to narcissistic denial of her behavior. This all being said my father isn't a saint either, he had an affair right at the butt end of things. Which she resented him for and gave her someone to place blame upon. But since then the abuse shifted to me and my sister, like most abusers I would assume, it was somewhat of a compulsion for to inflict pain on someone else. I usually took the brunt of it as my sister was only about 7 years old at the time. I had to quickly learn to hold my own against her, it turned me into a fighter which is something I hate about myself. This went on for years and the only reason we stayed with her was I think the degree of which she would threaten to take her own life or do something drastic... We felt like we had to, or at least I did. She did things in the past like try to crash the car on or way home from school with us inside, this happened on a few occasions and I refer to these instances as my first driving lessons as I'd usually have to grab the wheel.

Anyways stuff like this happened over the years getting less and less drastic as time went on eventually she was no longer suicidal, but had begun heavily drinking and would come home drunk and start screaming at one of us, which usually ended up in me bucking back at her to get her to f**k off. Though this happened I actually was able to stay pretty head strong throughout highschool, I had good friends and was pretty successful in my music classes, (academics not so much) to some degree I think I was unaware of how things at home were affecting my mental health up until I was about 16 when I hit a breaking point after a friend of mine who was also a musician committed suicide. The part that really struck me was the fact that I had understood why he'd done it. After that I got help and got a diagnosis. Though things had gradually gotten better with my mother since I was 13, it got really bad again after the death of my friend and not to mention the the death of my grandmother (my mom's mum).
She was heartbroken once again and understandably, but she became more emotionally violent and abusive again, this lead to more fights between her and I and eventually my dad stepped in and took me to live at his house with his partner full time, things were better but at this point I was on edge so constantly that I started to recede, I missed about a month of school because of the panic  attacks I was having constantly I stopped being able to sleep and eat, I started smoking cigarettes and drinking quite a bit. But the worst of it was the strains it took on my relationships outside the family, which had always been quite good. But the worst part of the way that I'd receded and basically went awol for a month was this relationship I'd formed with this girl lucy id met like a year and half before. She lived down the road from me and I was totally in love with her though it wasnt romantic at this point as she was seeing someone but we had a really good relationship as friends, and even though she was with someone she really loved me too, and up until that point having her in my life was the only thing that really got me through all the bulls**t with my mother. And right around the time that I kinda went awol for a while she broke up with her boyfriend and started seeing this other guy I sometimes hung around with at school and got into quite a bit of sketchy stuff with. So that was a real kick in the pants, anyways it got better after a few months and I was healthy again.

I lived with my dad and his partner for about a year until I was 17.5, and hadn't seen much of my mom, I had visited on occasion though. I eventually moved back in with her after some issues I'd had at my father's. At this point she'd gotten her shit together a bit more and wasn't as emotionally volatile, though she still went out drinking quite a bit, which I actually didn't mind as much because it meant I got to spend less time away from her, and my relationships were good again, including my relationship with lucy even though she was with someone I was happy I at least got to see her and socialize again because we'd spent so much time together since we were like 14 and had been one of my best friends, though things were still strained as months prior just after I had started getting better and gotten my sh**t together a bit I'd told her how I felt about her but nothing happened as it was  just as she was getting together with this other guy, so our relationship definitely wasn't the same.

At the age of 17.5 I was at this weird junction where I was happy and sad to some degree but more than anything I was kind of angry for a lot of reasons, but eventually just before my graduation lucy left her boyfriend for me, and things really turned up for a little while, we got together and I spent alot of my time with her, it was the first time I'd felt happy in a long time but more than that she made me feel like myself again, she reminded me who I was, without the anger at my mother, without the anxiety, without all the sinking feelings, and yunno it wasn't like it all went away like that, I still had my days.

So things were really good I was able to avoid any conflict with my mother most of the time though she was still abusive, though my sister was old enough and smart enough to know how to avoid it at this point though her relationship was still not good with my mother. my mother since I had left a year before had begun to rely on her for emotional support quite a bit and had become very emotionally manipulative with my sister, which she put up with because she still had the fear from being a little kid  of her mother threatening to leave us or harm herself. Things were better but still not what I would call good me and lucy after spending the summer after graduation decided to move away the following year, she was planning to go to university and I didn't really know what I was going to do but was glad I was going with her and was glad to be getting away.... Though time did not pass fast enough.

 I remember saying to her about six months away from the moving date that I felt like if I don't get out of here sooner I'm gonna loose it, and eventually I did I got really really bad a few months before when we were planning to move, I started heavily drinking because I was getting depressed again and this time I was spinning out of control I had no grip on anything whatsoever and I didn't even really know why, things at home weren't as bad as they used to be and I was rarely there anyways, I was able to keep it together for the most part, but never the less the way that I'd begun to change because of this spiraling depression and the excessive drinking, and so had Lucy we'd been together for over a year at this point so we broke up before the move, I didn't handle it well but it was the right thing to do. We both still moved and I eventually was able to move on and let her go because I knew she was starting a new chapter of her life and ultimately she'd led a different one than I had up until that point. So I spent a year still depressed but slowly trying to make myself better again, I've spent a year like this and am definitely better now. 

But I'm posting this here because I still haven't really felt the same as I once did, I'm still depressed in some way or the other. on one hand it's not like I'm depressed to the point of thoughts of suicide like I have been in the past, but on the other it still effects me every day and it feels like something I'll never be rid of it and will always impact me and my relationships and basically every aspect of my life.

I work early mornings (4am-4pm) outside and am by myself most of the day so I get a lot of time to think. Almost every morning I'm in a depressed state until the sue comes up. That includes thoughts like dreading the meaningless of life, thinking about how I will probably die from suicide instead of growing old, wishing my wife would leave me so I can do it, and how I would do it, ect. I generally tell myself if I was single I would be dead by now.

I also get these feelings when I'm up late on the weekend or sometimes the weekday if I had a bad day. At night I'll just listen to music and get lost in a game for hours.

I've started to realize if I sit without distraction for a few minutes I have strong bad thoughts come into my mind. I think I've developed some form of anxiety that I haven't had for the past ≈5 years I've struggled with depression. I took fluoxetine for 6 months when I was in highschool 4 years ago and stopped taking it because I didn't feel suicidal anymore, but I've never known if that was the medication or the honeymoon phase of meeting my now wife.

I was going to therapy but had to stop because I was low on money after some surprise vet bills and my insurance doesn't cover therapy currently so it's all out of pocket. I plan on going back soon and I'll probably have her read this. I really enjoy going and feel really nervous before every session but generally feel good afterwards. The only thing is I don't always feel super open to say what I've been thinking about because I've only ever told my wife the extent of my feelings. And I usually hold back as to not make her feel bad. I just don't know if talking about it will ever make it go away. There's a Pursuit of Wisdom video with the line ""how can I forget what I already know"" and that really describes how I feel.

Hi, I apologise if this doesn't meet criteria, or if this comes across as a selfish post, but I'm not sure what to do anymore.

I've been in a loving, committed relationship for 2 years, with a woman who is very depressed, frequently and consistently has suicidal thoughts, suffers dreadfully from anxiety, and has a considerable amount of physical medical issues.

At the beginning of our relationship the issues that she suffered with were not so prominent, they didn't affect her or us in any consistent way. I've always been aware of her issues, she's never hidden them from me, and I knowingly entered the relationship with this knowledge, and I will continue to love and support her in anyway I can.

I'll start at the beginning of this year, my girlfriend lost her job just before the first COVID lockdown (in the UK), and I went on our Furlough scheme, but I had a pretty bad paying job, taking around £1000 a month, while she was receiving no money from any sources. 

Due to her mass amount of medical issues, she smokes weed very consistently, and for pain management of her issues, she consumes a large amount of painkillers (which she has now been addicted to for some time). Because of these things, I have been spending more than I have been earning for the last year, I personally feel like I'm drowning, buried under the pressure, and I don't know what to do. 

Over the last month, because we're currently so poor, in lockdown in a tiny flat, and she still hasn't gotten a job, her depression &amp; anxiety have reached levels that I haven't seen from her before, and she is in a state now where she can't stop crying, she feels so desperately hopeless and suicidal, and she wont/cant do anything to help herself. 

I have been handling everything over the last year, from finances to housework, and I mean everything, it's been incredibly stressful and exhausting, especially considering my own mental health is not good at all, and I'm at a breaking point where I need to help myself, and I need to help her, and I can't do everything anymore. 

We can't afford therapy for her right now, UK is on lockdown again, and I am making things worse for her by feeling terrible myself, she is consistently bitter toward me, dismissive and uninterested, like me being around her makes her angry, despite me being the only reason she isn't homeless right now (As all of her family is in America, which we cannot fly to (due to lockdown), or even purchase a ticket (too poor)).

I'm lost and defeated, I love her endlessly, and will do anything I can to make this situation better, but every time I talk to her she starts crying, she wont get out of bed for the most part and it feels like she blames me for not helping her, despite me trying to do everything I can to support her, but I am suffering as well, and it feels like she resents me for feeling like this, as if it's my fault that I can't take care of everything for her. 

It's worth noting that none of these things have been said, she consistently reaffirms that she supports me, and doesn't blame me for our situation, or expect me to fix her problems, but the way she treats me says differently, and all I want is to get BOTH of our lives back on track.

I need help, I don't know how to talk to her, I don't know how to help her, I don't know how to help myself. 

I'm sorry this is so long, if anyone reads this, is there any advice you can give me on how to get through to her, how to help her, how to help myself from falling through the cracks?",I Need Help.,lucasadlerxo

depression,"It’s hard. Everyday is a struggle. Between my depression and ADHD I feel like I am drowning most days. On good days, I feel like I’m treading water. 

But it’s been really bad lately. Work, kids, home. Isolation. There are stressors in every part of my life; there is no respite. Making it so much worse: I feel like I have told three people that I need help and they seem to be ignoring me. 

I’ve told them that I was tired all the time. That work had worn me down. That I was burnt out. That I had nothing in life that I look forward to. That I feel overwhelmed. That I feel like I am going to crack any day. That even little things are getting to me. That it takes immense amounts of self-control to not snap at everyone.

I’ve told my wife. I’ve told two friends. 

I said, however quietly, help. And they heard. I know they heard because they stopped. They were concerned. They squeezed my hand. They brought it up again days later: you doing okay? Ha! Sure. I’m so much better. Thanks for asking. 

It’s hard enough to ask for help: I feel weak. I feel like I am an imposition. I feel like I should not be feeling the way that I do. I feel like I should not bring my problems to them. And I know that I am a burden and they would be better off without me. I feel all these things and, yet, I somehow spoke up. 

So now, I feel like I have no where else to turn. I feel alone. So deeply alone. I am not even sure that they believe me. After all, I am the one they usually lean on. I am the cool-headed guy that helps them figure their shit out. I am the one that doesn’t crack under pressure. But I am cracking. I have cracked. 

When I told them, they acted concerned or ask how they could help. But I don’t know what to say to that. Do you not know me? Have we not known each other for 20+ years? And in all that time, you haven’t learned something about me that you could use to help me when I am feeling at my lowest? So not only do I need to reach out for help, I have to have the wherewithal to walk you through step-by-step how to help me through my pain. I am a drowning man that has to ask someone to throw me a life preserver. I can’t.

depression,"My (35M) wife (36F), has been heavily depressed since we had to sell our house and move in with my family, due to financial struggles we ran into together. We were working on saving and moving on with our lives when Covid took my job, insurance, and most of our income since I am the primary bread winner. Since then I have struggled to find a job that pays even close to what I used to make, though I am working again. 

All she does is mope around and try to sleep as much as she can. She is on depression medication but that has destroyed our sex life and really doesn't seem to be helping with the rest of the symptoms. I swear to anyone reading this that I am doing as much as I can to make this better. I tell her she's beautiful and that I love her and that it will all get better soon. We have 4 children and I need her to be stronger for them. 

Meanwhile I am miserable too. Its not easy for a man who used to provide 100% for his family to suddenly be unable to do so. I am sure that I am some version of depressed myself, but I am able to keep it together because if I dont, no one is and my kids will suffer. I dont want to sound horrible but its becoming harder and harder to feel bad for her when she won't do anything to make it better. 

I've never dealt with this before and if I sound like a bad person then let me know. I do still love her and want her to be happy, I just feel like im hitting my breaking point. I can't afford therapy so im reaching out here in hopes someone has a good idea for me.

depression,"There was once a time when everything didn't feel so gloomy and I didn't carry weight in my head at every hour of the day. Believe it or not before I turned 16 I would have considered myself happy. Sure I was just as clueless about what I was gonna do with myself as I am today, but back then it was more of a blissful ignorance than a worrisome one.

When I think back to the person I was before I really even knew the ins and outs of depression I see a bright eyed, hopeful young boy who knew he had reason to live. A boy who could articulate himself without struggle or constant second guessing of his words. A boy who was comfortable and confident in the company of his friends and could be attentive, witty, fun and a good friend overall.

Realistically, 2015 was not a very long time ago. Yet I look back then and see a complete opposite to who I am now. When I succumbed to the bull-shittery that is depression I felt as though I lost who I was. And that i've been without it ever since. Once that joyful, interesting part of me had been stripped away it became a challenge to attempt to be me. And it still is.

depression,"As in the opposite of YES men, NOT that I literally don't have any men around me. So here in the UK we are back in lockdown. Since we can't meet anyone (all my friends have moved away now anyway), I've been planning stuff to do myself, on friday i went caving by myself which was pretty epic, i went to a place that is safe imo, obviously there's always a risk the cave falls in on ya i suppose but I'm careful. I filmed a lil vlog for my youtube channel too, usually i just post gaming videos. My plan today was to go paddle boarding  on a Lake called derwent water, ie. The lake that Maz kanatas castle is on in star wars ep.7. I had found where i was going to park on google maps, i was gonna buy a steak and cook it on a disposable bbq i bought in summer but never used (coz i got no friends le cri) and smoke a joint, then paddle board for 2 or 3 hours going to the islands, filming a lil vlog and just chill, for once in my life. Im so anxious all the time and never live in the moment, i don't really know how to relax. But yeah i wanted to chill on my board and on the islands for a few hours, eat some wild berries on the islands and listen to music. Then by the time i got back i wouldn't be high anymore. So i mentioned at dinner last night tht i was gonna go paddleboarding and my dad just looks at me at talks to me like im an idiot saying its too cold blah blah blah, like no fucking shit, that's why im not going swimming in it. I don't even have a wetsuit but i was only planning on getting my legs wet getting on and off the board, not going for a swim.

depression,"I just looked back at my childhood pictures and realized something, my head was always in the clouds? These past recent years I have finally came back down and I am lost. It feels as if it should still be 2013 sometimes... I say I miss my childhood, but then I realize how crippled I was with social anxiety. I used to wish to go back in time, however, now, I wish for another life. I'm 18, almost 19, and I don't want to keep seeing the years go by. 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2020 all blend in and it's as if I teleported here. I have gotten so used to COVID-19 and being free from society that I fear how I'll feel again when I have to go back. Like, it's only a matter of time before an event triggers an extreme response that I feel like I will eventually take. What's the point to live here and now, only to feel the same way, but worse, a few years from now? When I lose the only people I know and care for, what then? I do not even have a goal, a passion, and a career path to head down. I'm 18, and after these last few days, I never will be 18 again. Perhaps I do not belong here, I do not know. There is nothing of interest for me to do except read and play video games. Even that bores me from time to time. I lack quite a lot these days, that being motivation, energy, a will to live, a goal, a passion, interests, and more. I realized all the opportunities I wasted, I realized how I won't be able to go back in time, I realized that in a future year, I'll still feel the same but be older and filled with more regret. I can not seem to figure out where it all went wrong, but along the path I derailed. I have kept myself locked in with my thoughts, hidden from people, and with my words trapped in a bottle. My social anxiety feels like the guard to the gate, and I won't be able to sneak by. Depression, it's the new ruler, and I can see why it wants me to give up. I'll continue to live in the past, be a ghost in the present, and lost in the future. If I had a clear understanding of what happened after death, a warm welcome even if I arrived too early, and forgiveness, I'll probably already have been gone by now. I want to achieve something great, to be someone great, and to have a meaningful impact on the world. Yet, it feels impossible for someone like me. There are many aspects to a person's life, their personality, their characteristics, their history, past and current, their behavior, their drive, appearance, etc. For me, I seem to to be too well rounded and not perfect at a single thing.

depression,"I'm 25. I've been struggling with chronic depression for six years now. I've had major episodes, as well as minor ones. I've had therapy, medication, and sometimes both. I've recovered multiple times, felt good, felt happy, and I've fallen back down multiple times too. 

My parents know this and they're overall supportive. However, it's still hard for me to talk to them when I feel myself slipping into the darkness again. I feel guilty. And their reactions, despite their best intentions, don't help.

My mom refuses to acknowledge the chronic nature of my depression. She says I have bad days, but I can't afford to label myself as chronically depressed. She says I'm setting myself up to be depressed again if I use those words. I think she's just scared that it's real. And she can't do anything about it. Last week I told her I was feeling bad again. She would not accept it. It makes it hard for me to talk to her, I feel dismissed.

My dad scolds me when I tell him I've started missing classes and I don't feel up to anything. He says I can't just let myself ""fuck up yet another year"". I know it comes from a place of worry, but it hurts. I try to confide in him. I come to him for reassurance, and I hang up the phone feeling like the biggest disappointment of his life. Yesterday he called again, checking up on me. I couldn't pick up.

depression,"I am visiting this group, because I have  felt depression for a long time. Don't get me wrong, I have been happy in my lifetime as well, but it's harder to concentrate on the good things. Being sad to me is just comfortable, because I'm used to it. I don't really know how to be happy, guess I haven't been happy long enough to learn it. I feel like, when life goes good, like for me it did just few months ago. But even then sometimes I've missed the sadness, the tears, the anguish so to speak. And then I start to create problems to myself to get me there, at the bottom of the barrel. I don't mean to, but it turns out the way. I feel like I've pushed people away in my life, because I don't know how to be a proper member of this society. Often I feel like I'm an alien amongst humans. I feel very different. I avoid eyecontact, like it's sickness, I am very awkward person, I can't communicate freely, I'm a huge introvert, and I keep to myself. I'm a loner for the most parts.
The point of my story is, to my opinion I know exactly what depression is, because Ive had it over 10 years. And I think I have the right to say the following : I don't think, that these kind of groups helps, until there aren't people in here, who have a psychology background or that kind of experience to also say something positive and comforting, that there is light at the end of the tunnel. Otherwise very dark people only communicate to each other about very dark things, and that's very toxic to my opinion. I just hope, that people to get the comfort they need out of these kind of groups, so that their darkness won't get any darker.
Hope my point of the whole story comes thru, if it doesn't, then probably is my bad English here to blame. And then I apologize.
I really hope, that people like us, who have that dark black heavy depression inside, will find the answers we seek to get to the brighter side of life and we all should get used to be happy, to be free of dark thoughts, to be free of everything that might hold us back of living awesomely. 🙂 🙂 🙂",Depression group,lyrmyst

Today sucked alot.
The night before i dropped my friend off at home late at night.  Im on my way home when i get a call. He forgot a cord and needs it to charge his phone.  He also demands i replaced a cord because my cats destroyed his.  I thought, no way my cats destroyed his cord and i got pissed he was demanding i replace it.  He brought the cord, set it up, and took it down.  Anyways im pissed that he was demanding a replacement,  i probly would have offered to replace it if hed hadnt been so bossy.  But i go inside to look for the cord he forgot and the other part of the cord that got rekt.  Turns out the cord got to close to my chinchilla and he ate 6 inches of the rubber and parts of the metal threading.  I started to panic.

Best i can do is monitor and wait.  Next morning aka today my friend calls (hed been texting sorrys and calling vets all night)  and the convo dsnt go well.

I tell him that the vet isnt going to be able to do anything, iv raised chins for 20 years.  He respomds with a idc, i trust a vets words over yours. And then he says we need to have a talk about our friendship.  At this point im still really upset and irritated.
I call anyways and the vet tells me exactly what iv been saying.  Monitor closely.  Now all day iv been anxious about ""talk about our friendship"".  Our mutal friend is my roomate and he keeps reassuring me that i shouldnt worry about it but that dsnt stop me from worrying.   Later i tried to call and he was asleep and ddnt really want to talk but i tried to ask about what he said.

Topics of sexual abuse and suicide.

So I'm dealing with my own mood disorders with anxiety and depression while trying to care for my family. My aunt has been psychologically unstable since before I was born. She's been emitted more than once for suicide attempts and is always having conflict with people. Our family dynamics are admittedly strange. There's history of sexual, alcohol, and drug abuse. We still try to have normal family holidays but there's always that elephant in the room. My aunt always has to fight with my mom and my grandmother bringing up everyone's traumas over and over. She doesn't seem to care how that affects them and only focuses on her own experiences saying no one cares and that the whole family continues to abuse her. We've all done so much to find her therapists and have dropped everything multiple times when she's too sick to take care of herself or her kids. She doesn't see how much the whole family tries even though we are far from perfect. She's affecting everyone and continues to call everyone abusers. I told her to be careful how she uses that word and she sent me a dictionary description. No one is trying to invalidate her experiences and emotions but she also says a lot of things that may or may not be true. It's hard to tell because she contradicts herself so much. One minute she wants space from everyone the next minute she's causing a scene about no one cares enough. I honestly stress about the safety of my little cousins but it feels like there's so little we can actually do. 

I showed up to her house today because she did not sound okay and said her boyfriend was abusive. Then she got upset with me saying I was a pawn in my mother and grandmothers game to manipulate her and my presence in her house was another form of abuse. She didn't like that my mom shared with me since I'm the one who lives in the same town. She also went on to say her and her boyfriend were seeing a couples therapist and working through it. She said that no one had any business in it so I'm not sure why she then repeatedly messages my mom and grandma about it. She eventually cooled down and flipped to praising me for my pure empathetic heart which felt off and uncomfortable. One of her peeves is how we apparently put other family members on pedestals and degrade her but here she was doing that with me. Anyway I'm still feeling shaken up by the interaction. It triggerd some of my own trauma that my aunt doesn't even know about. Most of us want to distance ourselves but we have to look out for her kids.

how i feel right now is... the instrumental of “when you sleep,” by my bloody valentine. that one guitar part throughout the song. i don’t really care for the lyrics, i resonate more with the guitar 

i’m sad. i’m so genuinely sad. i don’t know why i cant cry. i wish this tightness in my chest would go away. i lay here and watch the fan spin on my dark ceiling, the blue glow poking through my curtains from the porch light.

i lay here in my unmade, dirty bed. sheets and pillowcases that have not been changed in nearly a year. i feel a tightness in my chest, i feel that feeling in my sinuses when you’re about to cry. but i don’t. i don’t know why. i feel the uncomfortable feeling right before your eyes begin to water. but they don’t.

the guitar plays in my head over and over. the soft coolness of the AC makes me shiver. my heart pounds a little. my lips are chapped and dry.

i feel the blood pump through every vein in my body. i hold my breath without realizing.

i wonder why i feel like this. there’s no answer really. i pray that someone walks in on me in this state, comforts me. but i pray that i’m never seen like this.

a tear finally rolls down my cheek. i swallow sharply and exhale. i wont be sobbing. it’s just a slight relief. the headache won’t go away.

my stomach twists and turns, all up in knots. i’m nauseous. i feel like i’m grasping for something that i cannot reach. i smile slightly at the ridiculousness of it. i feel like the sound of a few instruments together.

my legs are heavy. i have goosebumps all over even though i’m under the blanket. 

i feel like i’m going through a sort of numb heartbreak. but i haven’t. i have no reason to feel like this.

sometimes i just want to leave. not die. just... go far, far away. i want be a ghost of sorts, a spectator. i want to fly around the world and observe humans without being a participant. i want to watch people experience their ups and downs. but, i am human, bound to this physical, tangible body. feet glued to the ground. i cannot fly. i’m observable and perceivable. i cannot leave this place.

i feel like some tragic event has happened to me. a breakup, death of a loved one? neither of those have happened to me recently. i feel so hopeless. shattered into a million pieces and it’s so hard to pick them back up. 

i am under the blanket, but my entire body feels so cold. the tips of my fingers and toes are freezing. i have goosebumps all over. it’s as if this feel is manifesting itself physically.

just one of the many nights i spend in this state. 
the best i can describe it is

depression,"Hi, I've been struggling with depression and anxiety for a few years now. Last year I went to officially get diagnosed as well as get help and was unsurprised to hear my diagnosis of depression, generalized anxiety disorder and social anxiety disorder. I always knew but it kinda lifted a weight off my shoulders for it to be officially recognised.

Anyway I'm here because today and this whole year I feel like the only thing that has progressed is the year and not much else. 
I feel stagnant and it's difficult to confide in my therapist or the people around me, not because I think they won't understand. It's just both my therapist and my circle want to help me make progress when I'm kinda feeling that I'm okay with this stagnation. I'm very okay with this almost pause in my life even though I get anxious at times that I'm not moving forward.

I get why they want to help me move forward since I'm in my final year of university and we're currently doing distance learning. 

This year though has been tough and that's excluding the virus from my list of mental baggage. My year has gone something like off the rails. First my year started off with my grandfather passing away peacefully in January, My uncle also passed away in his sleep in late March and my aunt lost her fight to cancer in early April. Needless to say I was very close to the 3 of them and it left me in an emotionally raw state. I wish that there is where it ended. 
However that was not the case and because of my grandfather's passing, my grandmother came to live with us for a while and that saw a spike in my irritability both because of the lockdown orders and the grating personality she has that is difficult to handle under normal circumstances.

Anyway fast forward a while and I was slowly building up my mental stamina for the second semester. Naturally I failed the first semester due to the events described above but I was determined to at least accomplish finishing the coming semester.

Now it's exam time and I've done no work except for two assignments and I'm going to have to redo my final year next year. This is because I started my semester out by receiving notice that the institution which had been funding me had now decided to pull all funding for my year at the start of the second semester. They didn't give a reason as to why, they just pulled funding and because they also cater for allowance and accommodation they had essentially just doubled the debt I owed the university. This is because the university foots the bill for both tuition and allowance and charges it to my student account and the institution would then settle the account come year's end. 

Needles to say that was the straw which broke the camel's back and now I have no motivation to do anything work related and my mental stamina is exhausted. I don't want to work now either as I can feel the looming anxiety and depression waiting for me if I even attempt to get assignments done.

This would probably be a good time to mention that I live in a house with 13 other people ranging from primary school age all the way to almost retired and my mental fortitude has been exhausted trying to get anything done during this lockdown period. Living with 3 people is tough enough now imagine the mental strain that kids yelling until 5 in the afternoon, teenagers asking you to help with stuff, adults asking you to do them a favour and the perpetually on television that's always just loud enough that you can always hear it in the background of every waking thought.

If you've read this post then thank you for your time. I didn't go into how I felt and I just wanted to vent a bit to people I feel would understand. I'm just tired, I want to rest but modern life dictates that I need to be moving. I don't want to, my depression has got me sleepless and my anxiety has made me neurotic. 

TL;DR I'm diagnosed with depression, generalized anxiety and social anxiety. I'm tired and I just want to stagnate this year. Disregarding the virus and its issues my year has been tough. Lost family and my education loan which doubled my debt therefore am failing my final year of university. Live with 13 people that range all ages and they erode my mental health. Just wanted to vent to people who would understand my wanting to just wait out this year and rest a while.

depression,"Kind of semi new to Reddit. Have had a lot of different diagnoses, ranging from bipolar, generalized anxiety, depression. I don’t know if they’ve ever been accurate and the medications never worked. Been drinking so I’m not as much as a lurker with less inhibition. My question, is there a way to refocus and find your center with lack of better words? I want to be able to not rely on anyone, or have zero codependency. I use to isolate heavily, for years, but I realized it manifests delusions in me over time. Delusions related to solipsism was my previous experience. I mainly get my socialization out of romantic relationships now. The thing is they suck too. Dealing with a dead bedroom situation, not sure with your familiarity, but it is exacerbating what I do experience. 

Back to the question, I want to be able to not be codependent on anyone else for anything really. How could I potentially cut everyone out and isolate without suffering the side effects? Is it possible? I do experience depression with it but at least it’s stable and not at the whim of others. I feel weak and vulnerable.

depression,"Started back at the gym about a month and a half ago, no physical changes yet but slowly getting stronger and have been feeling a lot more positive in general. I'm starting to slip the past couple of days though. 

My dog of 13 years was put down at the start if June and it broke my heart. A couple of weeks ago my mum brought her old cage from when she was a puppy back from her friends house, along with a new bed, toys etc. and said she was ""thinking"" about getting another dog. I didn't want to make her feel bad about something that was making her happy, like my family has always seemed to do to me; so I kept my mouth shut (I don't want another), even though you don't buy all new stuff when you're ""thinking"" about something so I knew she was lying to me. 

On Tuesday, she announced to me that she was picking up another puppy the day after. I don't want another dog yet, I feel it is way too soon and that she is just trying to replace an irreplaceable part of the family. 

Now I am falling back into my depressed ways of not eating, speaking or leaving my room. I'm so conflicted because this new puppy keeps following me around and showing me affection, but I do not engage with it, because I feel like my dog is watching from somewhere and thinks I have forgot her. Im not comfortable with this puppy being here. I still see the house as my old dogs house.

I feel so bad, I know its not the puppies fault, but I feel like i'm betraying my old friend. all these people keep coming to the house and fawning over it and carrying on like my old dog never existed, whereas I still sit and watch TV in my room with my dogs ashes.

I keep wanting to shout at my mum, I think she should have asked me how I felt before just going and getting one and just thinking ""he'll get over it"", but I can't, because I know that it is making her happy, and I know how it feels to be made to feel bad/guilty for doing something that makes you happy or brings you joy, I dont want to be someone that makes people unhappy, like they have done to me so many times in the past.

depression,"I am 22. I am posting here because the only diagnosis I have received was a severe depression and anxiety as a child at 13 and have not gotten help since that time. I do also suffer from obsessions and what I am realizing are delusions that flood my thoughts during the day and fill my head with anxiety at night. At this point I am so disconnected from reality I outwardly look and sound like a shell of a human being, and have been told me eyes and voice and being are empty. I am constantly doubting I am here myself. I put myself completely through school and am graduating in a couple months. My estranged family who lives far will not be there and only a new relationship man will be. But he doesn’t seem to give much of a fuck anyway. I will be a new friends place, whom I am grateful to have.

Even if he doesn’t give a care, I will CHOSE to be ecstatic during the ceremony! Ive worked hard during all times of the day to put myself through school with my mind and my obsessions on my back. My twisted mindset that has tortured me for years, daily in my ear eating at me. Eating me up at night. Overwork felt like a therapy and penance for the shame of being; a balance and grounding to my sick mind and worthlessness. Days and sometimes a weeks needing to stay home were crippling. I could not move, only dissociation and getting lost in my obsessive thinking. A growing and profound despair, constantly fantasizing my suicide as an end to the suffering of the consciousness and living of every second. It felt and still feels inevitable. Even now I am afraid my mind is close to slipping into an incurable psychosis and insanity. Now more than ever (although ive been hearing I look sick for years) I am hearing even from strangers how void and sick I look. Of course this is not intentional. 

HOWEVER, I have put my everything into accomplishing this thing. Somehow I pulled it off. I WILL be ecstatic and celebrate, even if my suffering feels futile, it will not be. The lord blesses those who weep while sewing, I am not alone. Even with this plague deep within me which may be around for the rest of my life, I will make more money now to enjoy the luxuries and pleasures of life, and am greatful to be afforded a position at this table to eat.

depression,"Hi, 

I've been diagnosed with major depression about a year ago. In my particular case, it's really my living situation. I live in a country where I am completely socially isolated. I've been shunned, insulted, threatened, bullied.. but even that aside, I just haven't been able to make any friends here, not even rather superficial ones. I never had any problems making any friends in the other countries I lived in. Anyway, that's a situation that caused my depression. Covid makes absolutely no difference to my social isolation, except that I can't even fly out of the country now (which I was able to do twice a year before only for a few days each time)

I am now looking for ways to feel less socially isolated by connecting with people virtually. I have a few friends I chat with regularly, my close friends. But I am looking for other people to connect with, especially in a fun way.

depression,"My bad feelings have started relatively recently - about a month or 6 weeks ago. I live alone in a foreign country and came back from my home country around that time, back to work, and things there are extremely toxic at the moment. They weren't great before, but things really have taken a turn for the worse during my time away and since my return. 

Several of my colleagues are burned out, the boss is terrorising everyone and making everyone's life miserable, we're all under a lot of pressure (we are healthcare providers in this time of covid), and it's really taking a toll on me.

I'm constantly wondering why I have decided to come work here, away from my family. Theoretically I am ""searching for a better life"", but right now it does not feel better at all. It feels like I am just feeling angry, sad and frustrated at work for 10 hours at home, then coming back to an empty apartment and not having anything to look forward to. All the hobbies I had have either closed down due to the second wave (gym, pool, woodworking,...) or I feel too tired/apathetic to do them anymore (cooking, watching movies, play video games). So I just get home and feel worse because I cannot bring myself to do anything, and I stay like that until it's bedtime and I get up the following morning to go to work. 

At the same time, I still see one or two friends once or twice a week, and I do enjoy being with them, and I'm definitely not suicidal, just sad and anxious most of the time. 

Knowing the diagnostic criteria for depression due to my area of work, I think I definitely fall somewhere on the scale at the moment, but at the same time I just keep telling myself I'm being overly dramatic and that it's not that serious, which is keeping me from looking for more help. I have a therapist I have talked to about this, but we haven't had the time to dig deep enough, and my friends think it's time to see a psychiatrist.

I know I can't achieve anything in life because I am lagging behind. Everyday is a competition to survive. We are running, competing to stay alive. I am just tired. I just can't do it anymore. Run, compete. I can't. I feel sick. 

I was bullied in school because I was and am the unusual introvert who doesn't know how to talk cleverly and act smart, badly treated, insulted by people in high school, I have been threatened by my family members, sexually molested even by some of my family members, my love interests, my relationships Nothin ever ended up nicely??? and there's so much more??? I won't be able to complete if I go on talking about this.
I have grown up in a menacingly financially unstable environment which still continues. My life is a fuckin mess like what the fuckin shit is this?? Depression- I was diagnosed but I stopped treatment because I didn't like my psychiatrist (depression has always been a part of me since I was a child, now that I think of it. but never felt the intensity as a child) and it's been 3 years. Have Never spoken about it to anyone. Because I fuckin have no one? Anyone who enters my life fuckin leaves like I am some fucking stray dog and my already low self esteem further goes down. I feel terrible?? Like who would want to stay and even talk with a misanthrope, cynic, nihilist, lunatic anxious bag of meat? There's a mess, a cobweb of fears, emotions, anxiety, frustration lingering inside this tiny head of mine that I can't even express 1/4th of my problems here. Life is so fuckin rude?? All I need is a trigger and then things get out of control for me. Overwhelming emotions, frustrations, anxiety they all attack me like a deadly virus, eating up my brain in big chunks. I am so so so vulnerable to pain. Like why always me? Why always me? Why do I have to suffer everytime? I am a fool I know that, but never knew people can lose their conscience, their morale just like that?? Why always me? Everytime? Right from my childhood??? Why me! Ah fuck I feel like screaming until my lungs burst!

Can't sleep. I have suicidal thoughts every now and then. Sometimes I think of jumping off a building, that might not be much of a painful death or the other alternative is you know alcohol and pills. I take 8-10 sleeping pills everyday, if I don't then my thoughts, my fear, anxiety will turn me mad. It's a terrible thing that goes on in this head, dear. Waking up everyday is terrible, a haunting experience for me. I don't want to wake up. Sometimes I feel like hiring a hitman to kill me. But fuck me I am poor. Can't hire. 

I need to escape. I need an escape. This whole thing- the environment, the people, my life.. they are choking me.. 

I see people happy, hanging out with friends, laughing around, enjoying life. And me? I don't even get out of my room. I am there sitting in one corner doing nothing except overthinking and shedding tears. I have lost interest in everything- books, playing guitar, writing, singing. Nah nothing makes me happy anymore. I just don't feel like doing anything? I see no meaning in anything.

Suffice to say, it has not gone as planned...

I've watched my former peers and friends just snag up jobs quickly (good jobs, too), meanwhile it took me a year and a half to get a 12 an hour paying job, because I fucking couldn't get shit elsewhere. It took basically everything out of me to land this job, and I'm not sure when I'll even be able to move out.

depression,"Everyone I know prefers my sister.

&amp;#x200B;

I was born as a twin. Many people I know had said I was lucky for this, but I don't think so. I am constantly compared to her, my grades, my personality and my looks. This was mentally degrading growing up, and still now. In elementary school, I was constantly mocked for not being enough like my sister. I was considered the ""ugly"" and ""stupid one"", and I was always left out for anything social. I remember being left alone in the schoolyard during recess while my ""friends"" and my sister went off and played without me. 

People constantly told me that they wished I wasn't alive, and they wished my sister was here instead of me. I have no idea what I did wrong, but everyone hated me and loved my sister. When asked how they thought was cuter, people would always say my sister. When asked who they would rather hang out with, it was always my sister. And what did I do about it? Nothing. I couldn't do anything, or show any emotions at all. If I did, people would laugh at me and think that I was weak. I just put on a fake smile, acting like everything was okay. 

&amp;#x200B;

Whenever I had a valid point or joke, my sister would always repeat them, getting all the credit for it. I was basically used as her puppet to come up with ideas. And, if I said anything against  how I felt, I would get a huge ""Shut up"" to the face. I cannot say anything, not even a word about my feelings without my sister or my parents telling me not to. My mouth feels sealed with invisible tape. Whenever my sister expresses anger or frustration, everyone tells her that everything will be okay, and offer her help, not the ""Shut up"" I get. 

&amp;#x200B;

Sometimes I wonder if I should just kill myself, everyone prefers my twin anyways. I am just a useless replica of her, leftovers from a factory. I am not as smart or as pretty as her, and everyone feels the need to make that very apparent.

depression,"I (F23) was diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety a year ago, but it’s been going on for at least 7-8 years. Since I’ve been diagnosed I take medication and go to therapy. As a teen I was in a serious relationship with a guy (now M23) once, were 2.5 years together but I finally broke up with him 6 years ago since he belittled me, put me down constantly, used to laugh at me crying (which I did every day at the end), be annoyed when I needed help (I have endometriosis, severe phobia and sometimes I get panic attacks if the phobia triggers me) and so on. (I know a relationship couldnt really be serious since I was 17 but the long term damage it did is definitely serious). Guy was also a legit genius and I still have to hear about his new papers or something from mutual acquaintances. 
Since than, I haven’t really been dating, I’ve tried tinder numerous times but since I always only swipe right on guys I don’t feel threatened by, I usually don’t get past the first date (if at all) because I can’t bring myself to write back. I am conflicted, since as you can see, I’m the whole “won the health lottery and also I’m miserable” package and I don’t want to put this on anyone. I also have next to none sexual experience and no sex drive since I’ve started taking antidepressants. Still, I’m just lonely.
(I think it’s also important for you to know that I’m working to be a professional in a medical field and my program takes long hours and  is extremely hard and stressful, which doesn’t really help. I have 2 more years to go.)

So my question to you guys is : was someone here in a similar situation? How did you get out? I’ve been single for over 6 years now and I desperately want someone to connect with but no matter how hard I try I can’t really get out of my small lonely bubble and I know I don’t have much to offer. There is definitely more than enough guys who would want me for my body but that’s not an arrangement I’d personally be comfortable with right now.

depression,"I know I just posted something else (sorry) but I have so much on my mind. 

I'm debating with myself about whether to quit my job because I want to quit life. 

I have been depressed a couple years ago and I 'fixed' it myself. I got depressed again, wasn't very very bad but my relationship (also coworker) made my depression worse. He made me go over the edge, but also got me back because I love him. Fucking pathetic. As I said, we work together and that's shit but it's alright. It's been over for a couple days and I know my emotions are heightened right now, but I felt this way before we broke up too. I wanted to die. I see joy in my world, I do. I sometimes like my work, I like my coworkers, I like making stupid sarcastic jokes and I like seeing wonderful movies. I fucking loved cooking with or for my ex and I loved joining him on the couch and just cuddle. I loved seeing him naked and I loved that he liked seeing me naked. Because I didn't. I like it when people think of me, they text me or send me memes they know I will like. It gives me a feeling of being liked at least sometimes, but it also gives me no reason to live. I always was the friend that's not invited, or ignored, or least talked to. I never got attention from my parents. Not when I graduated, not when one of my relationships ended, not when I got promoted at work. I'm never the someone in someone's life that they want to live for. 

I know people always say that you have to live for yourself, you have to love yourself. Well I don't and I don't get it. I don't like who I am. I don't like that I question everything people say. I don't like that I'm insecure about everything. I don't like that I'm not funny,  I'm lazy, I'm not interesting. And I know there are people who think the opposite of what I just said, but I'm too afraid they won't. They think they like me but will eventually get tired of me. I don't want to live for that and not for me.

A few things before you read this post: English is my second language and I don't think I'm very good at it, so I apologize in advance for spelling mistakes, grammatical errors and misunderstandings. Also, this post will propably be very long and unstructured; I'm not expecting much people to read it anyways, only proceed if you really feel like it.

The problem I'll be talking about I've had since my later childhood. But it has become a lot harder to handle over the course of the last year: 

I can't get myself to do any task that requires a litte more skill than peeling a potato and takes longer than five minutes (shitty comparison, I know). 

Luckily for me, up till now this never really affected my grades (I'm still a student). One doesn't really need to learn when paying attention in class and one's pretty much forced to do so, when having no friends there; More time consuming asignments can be done the night before. Well, at least this was my go-to strategy till last year. Now tasks have become more challenging and I found some more effictive and creative ways to lure myself further into procrastinating. 

I don't know. Everytime I have just enough positivity in me to start a task, it just overwhelms me and I quickly go back to playing video games. I've propaby put more effort into them than my real life.

The reason I like my games so much is because -when rejecting every friend request you come across of course- noone has expectations for you. Unlike it works with real life. With every compliment comes an expectation: Teacher calls you intelligent? - Great now he thinks you'll always have an answer to his questions. Teacher compliments you on your homework? - Now she will expect your assignments to be extraordinary all the time. You told your friend you started running? - Now he will assume your faster than him.  You told your mother about that girl? - Great, now she believes you like girls and will go out with this one. What if you don't live up to these ideas of you? -Right, you dissapoint.

Every time I think about others thoughts of me I get overwhelmed. Even thought I try to keep expectations as low as possible, I never seem to feel freed from them. It's just too much for sensitive idiots like me. 

And here I am wasting away my days and blaming others for believing in me. -Like there is anything to believe in. 

Whatever, I hope you didn't have a stroke reading this, stranger because I for sure didn't proof read anything. Anyways, have a nice day.","Yay, another idiot posts about his problems .-.",accountgototreeeeesh

Currently on 5mg Dexedrine 3 times a day.

Recently  I was diagnosed with ADD because I couldn't take it anymore. I went to a  psychiatrist and spilled everything. Why I couldn't concentrate on  school, a lack of life progress, my porn addiction, etc.

I  believed that my depressive emotions were a symptom of my ADD. I still  do, because if I take my ADD medication regularly then my mood is  better. Although it does increase my anxiety by a little.

&amp;#x200B;

I've  never identified as a depressed person (maybe because of ego?) but my  emotions/actions say otherwise. If I listen to my emotions, then yes, I  am depressed - but if I listen to who I truly am, then no, I'm not  depressed.

&amp;#x200B;

Either  way, I've never been able to make progress in anything, ever, until  recently. Last week was the happiest I've ever felt in my life because I  had a personal breakthrough. With a combination of medication +  therapy. I had literally the best weekend of my life. I could finally **feel**.

&amp;#x200B;

That  still begs the question, am I neurologically depressed? I know that I  have ADD for sure... still not sure of the depression though.

&amp;#x200B;

My  highly intrusive &amp; deviant suicidal thoughts that I've had since  age twelve (probably earlier but 12 is what I can remember) have  substantially lowered but I still get them from time to time, although  they aren't nearly as strong nor frequent.

&amp;#x200B;

However  I don't want anything to do with thoughts like that. Maybe it's time to  go back to my psychiatrist and get treated for depression as well.  Again, I'm trying to be as objective as possible.

&amp;#x200B;

It  seems that every day, I have to fight my depression at least once. Like  I have to go to war, mentally. Maybe I'm actually fighting it right now  and getting it out of my system because this week has been the best of  my life

The game of life is already set in stone. You are outnumbered/outclassed and don't have the top resources. You can feel it that we are all in a game and we are slaves to money, so why bother even trying? To enrich yourself but does it really benefit you or anybody in the long run?

We are forever slaves to money and material goods and the internet and men who own the printing presses and they can travel the world for FREE while we have fork out money and we have to live in the fantasy land i.e. the internet which lacks that feeling which it won't ever get, so why do we keep doing work for these fuckers? That's why we keep asking for more stuff on the internet and it doesn't meet our needs.

Please stop working for government and corporations. Please stop producing content because you are only making the people that own the internet richer.

They are just here to leech your hard work and then use that against you and the people as a weapon to psychologically destroy people. They are not here for the goodness of their heart.

Having kids these days is cruel and evil and I'll be doing a disservice to the family and myself in reproducing for the long run. Even if you have a roof over your head. Something tragic will happen to the child or I'll lose him/her or she will get hurt which is why I think it's irresponsible to have kids or even reproducing.

Then later the media can run a story on you that you died a hero or run a story on you of how deeply flawed you are.

depression,"I was kind of on and off seeing a guy from last fall to spring of this year when the pandemic hit. It was clearly a toxic dynamic and now it's obvious to me that he used me mostly for an ego boost and didn't respect me. However when we were first getting to know each other, he was very sweet and attentive and it was also during a vulnerable time in my life (I was going through the loss of a family member). I was also unemployed at the time and looking for a job, and living back at home where I basically had no friends and not many avenues to meet new people my age. So I guess dating apps were my only way to be social and have some fun, and since he gave me so much attention at the beginning but then blew hot and cold, I became dependent on him even when he was giving me so little. Every breadcrumb, every sign he gave that might indicate he was really interested in me even though he clearly stated he wanted something casual. It literally felt like an addiction. I made so many excuses for him, that he was probably just shy or insecure or too emotionally traumatized and I had to bring him out of his shell. I ignored all of the red flags of his negging, gaslighting and failure to own up to anything. 

Now even though it's been the better part of a year since we ""dated,"" I still can't stop thinking about him completely. We haven't contacted each other since March, and even though we're not connected in any way anymore, I still find myself ruminating as if I'm reliving it sometimes. Of course there are some days and weeks where I haven't thought about him at all, but then other times he just seems to worm back inside my head to the point where I can't think about anything else. And then I fall into a period of lethargy and sadness, with basically little energy to devote to anything useful. Sometimes I also have trouble sleeping from anxiety, as thinking about some of the shitty things he's said/done to me literally jolt me awake. In an attempt to combat this, I have been on 3-4 first dates since him, but instead of distracting me, I find myself comparing the other guys to him and how they'll never live up to the initial spark that we had. Even though I now have a job, am interviewing for medical school, have a good friend that moved back home that I see at least weekly, and have gotten back into hobbies like running, and overall just have a lot that I should be happy about, I feel terrible about myself just because this one loser guy rejected me. I tried to pour myself into my work, hobbies, and interests, but thoughts of the relationship always somehow find a way to creep back in. I also know it's completely irrational and that just ends up making me feel more pathetic.

depression,"I can't keep convincing myself life is okay or worth it. 

I know some things in life are 'worth it', I mean, I would miss not having kids. And now I would also miss someone loving me with all their heart. I fucked up. I was dating someone from work and he made me feel amazing but also the worst. He made me feel insecure by not assuring me he loves me deeply and doesn't want to lose me. He thought it was bullshit because he was showing me with hugs. I fucking get it but I begged him to tell me at least once in a while, to look me in the eyes and tell me. 

He knows I am depressed, he knows I tried to kill myself multiple times and I even tried during our relationship. I told him he made me feel worthless sometimes and the depression and anxiety made it much worse of course. He didn't try to stop me. He just told me he thought I wouldn't do it. 

But now, 3 days ago we had a fight. I asked him and begged him to say it. To tell me he loves me deeply, tell me wat he likes about me and that he doesn't want to lose me. He couldn't. So I said I guess we're done then. We still slept in the same bed that night. We cuddled up.. Next morning I went to work and he went to work a couple hours later. So we worked together. I got off a little early because I was very emotional. He didn't say a word to me but when I left I got a text saying 'You're gone when I get home right?' I said no because I had to pack literally all my stuff and he just said 'You better be'. 

And you know what? I waited till he got back, didn't know if I was making the right decision but I wanted to talk. We talked, he told me he didn't want to lose me. He told me now, not when I needed to hear it. I begged for him back you know, I told him the only reason why I needed the reassurance is because I was too afraid to lose him. And it's true. I never wanted to but I was too afraid and I felt like I was never good enough. But he said he feels to much pride to get back with me after I told him it's done..

I hate that he made me feel the best and the worst at the same time. I feel stupid for begging for his love. But why does it hurt so much. Why do I cry all the time, I can't even function at work. Why does this hurt me so much when I know he wasn't all good for me. Well maybe because I wanted him to be all good for me, I wanted him to never leave me. But I fucked up.

I cant find myself doing things i love or even need to do anymore like im many weeks behind in some of my school classes and things i loved like streaming movies with friends or going out with my family dont make me happy anymore and the worst part is that I WANT to do those things but i seriously cant make myself do them.

depression,"im 19. i have to move out of my parent's house in two days. not because my parents are forcing me. not because my parents arent kind and understanding. im moving out because im a horrible failure, and i cant do it anymore. i cant live here while being like this. i failed college, for the second time. for no good reason. money wasted. my dad is helping me pay what financial aid doesnt cover. he doesnt even have a job anymore, he should be keeping what little money he has left for his retirement. but he thought i would be studying hard for a better future.

as of right now my parents dont know that im failing again. i knew i wouldnt be able to pass since around the 10th of this month. so it's been a couple weeks, and in this time ive found an apartment, signed a lease, taken a loan on a car, and im going to move in on friday. i was going to leave a note explaining everything, saying im sorry, and that i hope they will forgive me one day and allow me to visit often. i want to continue my education, i dont want to keep working in fast food for the rest of my life, but i cant allow my dad to help me pay for it anymore, and i cant stay with my parents for the rest of the time that i try to complete college. im so ashamed. so i was going to leave in secret, but i cant anymore. a couple days ago after work i drove to boston, for no specific reason, i just wanted to see the harbor, and then i drove back home. my parents were worried because i usually come back around 3, and i was back at around 8. i dont have any friends or anything, so for me to come home late worried them. i also have told them in the past that i wanted to kill myself, which is why i said i failed and took a semester off college originally, but now ive done it a second time, so i dont know, maybe i just convinced myself i was suicidal because that would be a better alternative to facing the fact that im actually an inherently lazy selfish liar.

so they were concerned, and now theyre suspicious of me for staying at work later, or going anywhere at all. im moving in two days, and i still need to do some logistical things, like pick up my aparment keys, and register my car. so i lied to them. i said i had made a friend, and that was the reason i will be coming home late after work. no one in my family believed me, because i havent had any friends for about 7 years, but i looked her in the eyes and told her it was the truth. she asked me if i was alright, if im depressed again because ive been acting weird. she just said she's worried about me, just to tell her where i am if im home late and stuff. and i looked her in the eyes and i said okay, i will tell you, im not lying to you. i know this sounds ridiculous, but it means a lot to me. whenever she wants to make sure im telling the truth, she asks me to swear on my cat's life. ive never lied before on her life, but now i did. so im a real liar now. im going to break her trust. im going to be a real failure now.

i just want to leave on good terms with her, but i cant tell her before i register my new car, because she will hide the keys or something to the other one i share with my brother so that im unable to pick it up. what else can i do to apologize to my family, besides telling them im sorry and not letting them waste their money on me anymore?","i dont know if im doing the right thing, but it's too late to back out now. help me make amends with my parents as best as i can.",anotherfuckingloser2

depression,"So a little background... my mother has severe bi-polar depression, she takes meds for it and has for quite some time. I have 2 brothers they look more like my mom than I do, I take after my dad, and they have severe bipolar depression but they don’t take meds for it. 

As for me, I have extremely minor symptoms, but when it happens I’m down and out for a couple days at a time. I notice that when I start to have these symptoms I have suicidal thoughts (mostly when I’m going to bed and often fantasize about how I’ll do it) but I would NEVER act on it. I notice too that these thoughts only come out at night. As for the rest of my symptoms I have like a brain fog, I can’t focus, I have zero motivation, people tell me I have sad eyes when I don’t even realize I’m making a facial expression. But then one day, I wake up and I’m back to normal. Happy go lucky, pumping on all cylinders at work and knocking out my creative endeavors with passion.

However my main fear is me becoming my mom. I’ve noticed over the years that my mom isn’t the same as who she was before she took meds and honestly that’s scares the hell out of me. She sleeps for days at a time, she doesn’t clean her house, she doesn’t shower, she never used to be so bad.... I don’t know if is the meds or if she is lying about of regular she takes them and this is just her, but she didn’t used to be this way.

depression,"I have been feeling so low, I haven’t felt like this for 4 years. My chest feels heavy, I cry all day and night, I have no appetite.

Life has been so good, work has been busy since COVID and stressful due to management being pricks. I knew this was affecting me and I knew I was going to dip. But just not this much. 

I am crying over things that happened a decade ago that I confronted 5 years ago. My husband (then boyfriend), was having an affair with my cousin, who was my best friend and we grew up together. I didn’t know it at the time, I always had a feeling he was cheating but always had the wrong girl. He made it seem as if I’m crazy. But I was right. He told me 3 years ago, came clean as he wanted to get married. Don’t get me wrong, I am in no way an angel and have done stuff too, just not with his cousin. Later, I found out he did the same with a very good friend of mine at the time. Being cheated on is shit, but having people close to you stab you in the back - when they were the ones you’d cry to about being cheated on. They knew all along, they consoled me. Just writing this is making my heart ache. 

It’s been 5 years since all this came out. I cut off all ties with my cousin as she got married and denied everything. She couldn’t deny it anymore once I sent her all the pics he had of her (another issue altogether as it was saved in a folder called “wanking”). I’ve always had low self-esteem when it comes to looks. However, I have always been smart and I worked hard. I grew up lonely because I had my cousin at school to hang out with so didn’t end up making any new friends. 

With all my friends support, I got through it. I was more confident (despite my husband telling me I’m fat and lots of other things) and I was happy being on my own. I no longer felt my world was going to end if my boyfriend and I split up. Obviously, as he is now my husband, we got married. We had to live at his parents for the first year and a half and as you can imagine, this wasn’t the most pleasant experience. 

Trying to get married was difficult. Although we had been dating for 8 years, it was kept private as we are both Muslims in the UK and pre-marital relationships are not allowed. When he told his parents he wanted to marry me, they were reluctant as my mum had been married twice (don’t know why they think it’s genetic - Asian culture is so backwards). However, he said he’s going to marry me regardless of what they say but they came around. Not the best start and then clashing with his mum. Oh my god, mother in laws are really from hell aren’t they? I played my part of being a good daughter in law whilst working full time. 

Last December, we finally moved into our own place. That was a struggle altogether. Having a husband who’s had a mum do everything all their life, it was exhausting. But he has improved so much and it’s amazing. Corona has been a blessing for me as I do not have to see the in laws much. 

Also in July last year, my husband went on a work trip to Atlanta. It was a few days of what would be our first wedding anniversary and I had the stomach flu. I suffered in his parents house then went to stay at my mums as I felt much more comfortable. Once he was back, he continued being rude, calling me fat etc. 

He acted like this when he first cheated so I went through his phone. He had been messaging women in Atlanta trying to hook up with someone. Not only that, he even sent my naked picture with my face blurred out for some reason - to turn her on? I don’t know in what world that makes sense. The way he was talking was disgusting, I was used to getting messages like this from other guys but I didn’t respond. He was even willing to book a helicopter ride over Atlanta so the girl would come over! She made it clear she wasn’t going to do anything sexual and he said it’s fine. Obviously I was heartbroken after this. I felt so trapped, I was now married. Divorce is frowned upon. However, I just took it and worked through it. I wasn’t surprised anymore I guess. 

Now, he’s acting off again. I went on his phone, he is wanking over all sorts of people on Reddit and 4chan. I don’t really care. What upsets me is he would rather wank than sex with me. Am I that unattractive? He loves the idea of me being with other guys. Clearly I hate that. So we just don’t have sex. I have said all this to him about how I feel. When I spoke about it face to face, he laughs it off or threatens “to go upstairs” and other times, I have been so angry and in tears, he refuses to talk to me. I’ve messaged him numerous times about how I feel, he’ll open the message and not respond. I know he’s on his phone all the time. He prioritises everyone else, his friends, cousins etc. 

I also found him save a picture of my cousin from before to wank over a few months ago. I decided to read through my messages around the time when everything came out and she said to me that he asked her out multiple times. And that at one point when we were on a break, he asked her again if she’d ever be with him and she said no. He denies it. She denied the whole thing at first. I don’t trust any of them. 

But what do I do now? I know I don’t want to exist but I could never ever do that to my mum, sisters and friends. They are my life. Do I just continue to suffer in silence and stay with a man who will not bat an eyelid when I’m bawling my eyes out next to him? I feel so lost and haven’t felt this low in so long. I feel like it’s built up for the last 3 years and it’s hit me and I’m drowning. 

I don’t really expect any responses. I just needed to get this off my chest onto somewhere where I know someone may read it. Even if they don’t, perhaps one day someone will. I just don’t know. I hate this feeling.",Just need to get this off my chest,LostUnderstanding766

depression,"There's two types of romantic heartbreak. One is that you were with the person and loved them but they stopped loving you, they left you, and you got nothing but the painful memory of them, you pray that they come back but you know they won't.

For the few sessions I went, I don't know why I did this but I ended up just lying through my teeth and spent them basically telling her that I'm fine, other than I have some social anxiety from a few traumatic experiences that happened to me as a kid. I also massively downplayed the gravity of the trauma I've been through. Eventually it hit me that if I'm going to play pretend, why even go, so I told my mom that it wasn't working for me.

Everytime my dad would yell up until I was about 13 or 14, i'd flinch, keep in mind I have a good relationships with my dad, and he has never hurt me, or verbally abused me.

As for my mum she's very passive aggressive when she's angry, mumbling loudly, slamming things, if she gets like that when driving she'll speed. When I was about 3 I remember helping her off the shower floor after she had gotten drunk (which left me scared about her drinking ever since) ages 5-7 I remember her cutting her clothes or hair angrily. When I was 13 we had gotten into a fight and I left, I came back to see she had used sandpaper on her face. 

I have depression and anxiety on top of this. Its very hard for me to cope, I have big dreams (neuroscience!) And it's very difficult for me to stay on track with all of this.

depression,"This is going to be a controversial take on this sub, but I strongly believe that everybody taking, or considering taking meds deserves to be informed of this; In general, the efficacy of psychiatric medication is marginal at best and there is an ever-growing body of evidence that these drugs seriously worsen long-term outcomes of depression. Disclaimer:&gt;!Don't suddenly discontinue your medication. If your medication works for you, then that's great and I'm happy to hear that! I know that it can work for some people!!&lt;

Let's start with the narrative that depression is caused by a ""chemical imbalance"". Gen Y, and especially Gen Z, grew up with this narrative reinforced over and over by society, doctors and other people we grew up trusting. It was sold to us as a narrative of science. Pharmaceutical companies began developing new drugs to ""fix"" the imbalance. To return the brain to a normal state. We were led to believe that these drugs were safe and effective and needed to be taken to get better. But what can be seen today is that this narrative was a marketing story, not a scientific one. It was promoted by pharmaceutical companies to create a mega-billion dollar cash cow. They were allowed to reach the top of the food chain and operate in a way where obeying the law essentially became optional.

Clinical trials that do not favor a companies interest are frequently not reported as they have no obligation to, while there is an over reporting of favorable results. The AHRP found in an analysis that up to 50% of articles appearing in mainstream journals are ghostwritten and that when SSRI's were brought out, the FDA expedited drug approval at the same time that they were burying evidence of adverse effects. And all this slimy behavior to pump out meds that are competing neck and neck with sugar pills?

&gt;Researchers using the Freedom of Information Act, obtained FDA reviews of every placebo-controlled clinical trial submitted for initial approval of the six most widely used antidepressant drugs approved between 1987 and 1999 - Prozac, Paxil, Zoloft, Celexa, Serzone, and Effexor. They found that on average, placebos were 80 percent as effective as the drugs. 

And 80 percent is the lower bound because these companies sure as hell conducted the trials in a way that would slide the results in their favor. These pieces of shit running the pharmaceutical companies knew their drugs increased suicidal behavior by two to six times and didn't make this information available. It wasn't until they were sued too many times by the families of suicide victims that the FDA had to step in in 2004 and mandate black box warnings on all antidepressants. 

There's also piling evidence that long-term antidepressant use may be depressogenic.. that is, your depression progresses to a more malignant and unresponsive state. Without even diving into the side effects and withdrawals, this information alone should be enough to inform you that taking these drugs is a RISK that probably WON'T pay off. I find it barbaric and sickening in 2020 that our first line treatments for depression leave millions of vulnerable people worse off than if they just didn't take anything. Prescriptions for these drugs are skyrocketing but we aren't seeing a decline in depression rates and hospital admissions for suicide. We are seeing INCREASES. These pharmaceutical companies are throwing fuel on the fire and getting rich from it. We need to fix the way society treats depressed people because these drugs aren't it.

depression,"hello everyone, i’ll start off by saying that i am 21 years old and i’ve been diagnosed with PTSD, depression, anxiety, and OCD (although it’s technically just trichitillamania) since 9 years old 

although you’d think after extensive therapy and going to psychiatrists since then, i would have been able to find a way to deal with this by now, that is not the case.. it comes and goes from worse to better, but as of recently (the last 2 weeks) it’s getting extremely difficult to handle my day to day life

i am medicated btw

i have been having panic (or anxiety?) attacks for the past 2 weeks a couple times a day.. there’s nothing specific i can think of that’s causing this all to spike randomly

last night i genuinely considered suicide again, however, i know i will never do that because i can’t stand to leave my animal babies alone while i’m at work, let alone forever 

my boyfriend has been extremely helpful through this whole thing, but there’s only so much a person can do.. i’m finding it hard to go to work, and do just simple tasks.. i just want to sleep all the time but the anxiety keeps me awake.. it’s not just at night time, i feel very sad and anxious even now, at 8:15am

i don’t exactly know what i’m looking for here, i just don’t know what to do.. i have another appointment on monday to possibly find some other type of medication to help me with this, as that’s all i can think of.. so.. yeah, that’s all! thank you to anyone who replies",My mental health is deteriorating,brennamenna
depression,"Everything is a constant state of expectations being shattered and constant, irregular despondency. I had prayed so hard for the past few months for covid to be done - or at least allow for it to be safe enough to travel. In my country's capital, they had just allowed people aged 15-65 to walk around and wander. I luckily, or not so luckily was able to catch the last flight to my province where it is safer virus wise. All ages are allowed to go out but I could honestly care less. The only person I want to see rn is my gf. We got separated due to covid 1 day before our second (march 10) monthsary and ldr is killing me. How is it fair that the only person I ever fall in love with was asundered from me so abruptly - why must the first person I love like this be taken away from me. And now I just read that our province cancelled flights for people below ages 16 to travel.  Over the course of the months I had developed depression and anorexia. What had I ever done for this to happen? Life is so unfair and I hate it. Why be born just to suffer? The thought of dying at 72 scares me - suffering for the next 56 years sounds torturous.

I've fallen behind in my tasks at home and I'm underperforming at work. I've gained like 40 lbs in the last 6 months and I keep putting off exercise. I think I need help.

I don't want to go to a local therapist... the culture where I live doesn't really inspire me to go to a local therapist because I feel they're likely to be either poorly trained or chock full of cultural paradigms that I don't share.

Online therapy seems expensive and I really don't want to add $400 a month to my monthly expenses, more specifically I don't want to have to explain to my wife what that $400 charge is on the credit card.

On the [NHS website](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/clinical-depression/treatment/), I saw that some doctors in the UK will leave people under observation and it recommended trying certain types of [self-help](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/stress-anxiety-depression/self-help-therapies/#apps-and-online-tools-for-mental-health) and CBT? I was hoping to give this a try. Does anyone have some suggestions or recommendations about these kinds of treatments?

depression,"I have a weird situation. I'm 26 years old, have an awesome wife, a kid (6 months old), nice job and i still fucking hate life. I'm living the life a lot of people would love to have, and still i think about suicide few times a week. 

I'm like this from childhood (which was pretty fucked up, but i don't think about that anymore), i had my first suicide thought at age 10. I don't understand why is that and how to change it. I was addicted to weed, when i quit i got addicted to alcohol, but i quit too. I'm slightly obese and cant lose weight, because after dieting for a week i constantly think about killing myself. Like junk food is the last thing that satisfies my mind. 

I thought about going to psychiatrist, but they mostly dont care and just give you some meds (which im afraid i will become addicted to or have big side effects). I went to psychologist a few times, but she betrayed my trust and from that point on i can't trust any psychologist. Do You have any ideas what should i do?

depression,"I've been working through my depression for 8 years now since I got diagnosed and have certainly been at some low points with it. However, since I've been to therapy 5 times over the years and am now in a healthy relationship for a year I felt pretty secure even going through my episodes. I can tell quite soon when they start, I can speak openly with my mum, best friend and partner about it and have therefore a great support system around me. I'm also not afraid of going back to therapy, although I don't see the necessity yet. 

Long story short, a few weeks back I've started to have nightmares. Nothing too personal usual, sometimes I'm being chased, the other day I've seen animals being hurt. Just really not nice things and they started at the same time that I noticed me going depressed again. Naturally I focused on getting better again, slowed my life down a bit and did more of the things I love. In the past these things have helped me a lot. These nightmares do not seem to get better though. Usually around the morning hours I wake up crying (yes, every time) and need to calm down a lot before being able to go back to sleep or just to get up. 

I guess I've been hoping that maybe some others have been affected by this and could help me out. My overall lifestyle shouldn't trigger bad sleeping, my schedule is pretty relaxed since the pandemic and nothing is really stressing  me out. I don't snack or smoke/drink before going to bed and try to work out 2-3 times a week.

depression,"I’ve been at my current work place for over 5 years. It’s a smaller dental office, privately owned, and we are like a family. I love my job there, although there isn’t a ton of room for growth and it has its own issues like any other job.

I was approached out of the blue by my old office that I left 8 years ago. They want me to come back on as office manager of the entire clinical aspect. I loved my old office too, but left because of poor management at the time (or a complete lack of management.) the new job is double my pay, only 4 days a week, with a ton of flexibility in schedule and way more vacation time.

I have depression and anxiety. So any time a tough decision comes up, I have a really hard time handling it. Earlier this year my husband and I decided to sell our starter home and upgrade. I cried and cried about leaving our old home even though I hated it and wanted to move for years. We have an almost five year old son so I was emotionally attached to the home. We ended up finding an amazing house I’m super happy in. But it was a month of agony during the process of deciding to list and leave and I doubted myself constantly.

Without boring everyone with the details, accepting this incredible job offer is something I know I have to do. During the week of deliberation on whether or not I was going to do it, I lost 8 pounds in a week. I could hardly eat. I was beside myself with stress. At my current job I’m the only one who can do 80% of the back office duties because I’m the sole full time assistant. I feel awful about leaving my current office because I know how much of a bind it’s gonna put them in. My boss, who’s like a brother to me, is pissed. Not to my face, but I know he’s hurt and angry and feeling betrayed. The office manager who’s like a second mom wasn’t supportive at first but she told me my family comes first and she wants me to be happy, but she thinks I’ll hate my new job. 

I’m sorry if this is a rambling mess. Difficult life decisions and career changes are hard even without depression and anxiety. It’s hard to separate what your intuition is telling you vs if it’s just anxiety and depression talking. I think it’ll be a good fit for me if I go into it knowing it’s gonna be a a change and initially I may have a hard time adjusting. I think I’m just scared because I can’t tell if I’m making a horrible mistake or if it’s depression trying to run my life and not letting me enjoy this new opportunity. Everyone in my social circle and family agrees this is incredible and that I’ll do amazing. But now I’m faced with four weeks of continuing to work at my current place until my start date in November at the new one. And now I don’t know how I’m going to survive until then. I don’t know what I’m looking for by posting here. I know I’ll have regrets if I don’t do this. On paper it’s a good move.

A complete random scenario pops up in my head, triggered by literally anything, be it a video that I've seen online, or just a rogue thought that flew across my mind, even if it was for a split second.

And I go through as it was real. Every single detail of it feels real. Not the process, not the event itself, but the emotional aftermath of it. It could be any scenario, however unlikely it would be to happen. It will still hurt at full capacity.

For the past few months, my resting heart rate is around 100BPM. When I wake up, it's 70, but very unsteady. If jumps up to the regular 100 as soon as I become fully conscious.

Even watching an F1 race, which I really enjoyed in the past, becomes a constant battle of trying not to start screaming and rip your heart out from your chest.

I'm growing sick of my pain. I try to eat, just to not pass out while walking. A full meal of breakfast makes me feel sick for the whole day, and I cannot even look at food.

I shouldn't have picked up meditation. It's a good thing, but not for me right now. It creates an illusion, an illusion which is really hard to escape from. I have to fight back my way into the 'real world' every time. If I could, I'd be constantly meditating. But it isn't something that I can do in my surroundings, as there are 'more important', material things to chase, fake smiles to keep, fake positivity to spread.

On top of that, it made me more aware of my emotions. It made me understand them. And that would be a good thing, if my own brain wouldn't be wanting to kill me. During meditation, everything makes sense, I feel peace, warmth, love from something divine, all I deeply crave for. But it drives you in. Escaping it becomes harder and harder, every single time. All you want to do is to go back. To let it consume you. To submit yourself to unknown forces that are hiding in your subconsciousness.

I don't think I've had a panic attack per se, but I do find myself fixating on all the negative and almost hyperventilating...

I quarantined alone with covid for 7 weeks, halfway through which my wife stopped talking to me. When I finally tested negative she told me she wasn't coming home, that she was happier staying with family than she had been with me, and she didn't know when she'd like to talk about it.

If you'd like to read more about all of that, you can check my post history for a more detailed account.

At any rate, I have not been mentally Ok for a while now, so my doctor put me on Wellbutrin. 150mg, I think... And also Lorazepam for anxiety attacks... I believe that is 1mg, but that sounds awfully low... I might be wrong.

She didn't really go into details about what to expect, just told me to contact her immediately if I had any strong thoughts of suicide...

depression,"I’ve really been struggling with how to coexist peacefully with my elderly parents. I feel incredible hate toward them lately, and rather than send them another angry missive that they will undoubtedly ignore, I need to vent here. 

On top of the fact that my parents are passive white supremacists, they were also guilty of child abuse and neglect but were never caught. They ALWAYS drove while drunk, and always with drinks being poured on the ride home, with my brother and I (young children at the time) in the car. I used to think liquor bottles rolling around in the car was the norm, and part of me still probably doesn’t appreciate just how fucked up it was. My dad would almost exclusively show up to family events annihilated after crushing a 1/5 of vodka on the two-hour drive to my grandma’s house. One time when I was 16, we were getting ready to go to grandma’s, and I told my dad I wasn’t getting in the car with him if he was going to drink and drive. They left me home and went without me. My dad would regularly get ejected as a spectator from my brother’s little league and high school baseball games because he was wasted and yelling at everyone. He had to watch from the car where he would fume and continue to drink. He’s been sober about 17 years now, but NOT ONCE has he ever apologized to me. Not once. In fact, a few years ago he actually said he didn’t think he was ever an alcoholic. Excuse me? Wtf are you talking about? He was drunk ALL the time. Him saying this absolutely crushed me. He will never accept responsibility for what he did to us. 

What occurred to me recently, though, was exactly how much danger they were putting us in. On top of the regular physical and emotional abuse (for which my brother and I are both traumatized, medicated, and in therapy) they literally could have had us taken away from them if they had been caught. Driving drunk with open containers and minors in the back seat? They probably would have gone to prison! And where would my brother and I be? Who knows. I’d probably be dead from suicide. My brother, too (we’ve both tried twice). We’ve both had a lot of issues in life due to our upbringing.

So here we are today. We’re both in our late 30s,  and we’re both struggling. My brother recently told me that, while my bro was just a teenager, my dad said on multiple occasions “the only thing women are good for is pussy.” Who is this trash person? How do I have relationships with people who believe and do such horrible things? Do I have to? They are not good people. Unsurprisingly, they are huge Trump supporters.

depression,"I've had a hell of a year (unrelated to current global events).

I finally just got out of an abusive friendship that slowly turned toxic in the end of 2017. He traumatized me so much, he sexually assaulted me once while highly intoxicated (I was sober) and isolated me from everyone else with his lies and manipulation. He had even been violent towards me several times, but he had no memory of those occurances due to his intoxication. We weren't even in a romantic relationship. We were friends for the last 13 years and I never saw his true nature until I was so beaten down that I tried to end my life. 

I fear for the women he dates long-term in the future but there's nothing I can do anymore. He is 30 years old, I can't do anything to help him or change him.

I became free from it and tried to start living for me again after putting my life on hold for years to take care of him during his alcoholism and drug addiction.

So I downloaded bumble to meet people with and make an attempt to put this all behind me. I actually hit it off pretty well with a guy who shared a lot of my interests and seemed just as awkward and weird as I am. He invited me over and I jumped at it, though normally I wouldn't go to a stranger's home right off the bat.

I don't regret it though. We spent the evening together, talking about everything, getting to know each other, and playing video games together because we're both big nerds.

Today is the next day and I am at home now. I broke down crying because it was the first time in a long time that I laughed so much with someone and had genuine fun. It was the first time in a long time that someone had ever held me and touched me so carefully. It was the first time in a long time I had kissed someone and been with someone. It was the first time in a long time I was so vulnerable with someone and still receiving respect towards me.

It was from those things that I realized just how alone I've been the past few years, how much my so-called ""best friend"" had fucked up my being, my heart, and my worth. That person had beaten me down so much. 

I cried when I finally had a glimpse of what I had been missing this whole time, something I didn't know I craved until it was in my sights and within my reach.

depression,"I'm a 22 year old American male and I've been dealing with exponentially worsening depression since I was around 12 or 13 years old.  I'm about as average of a guy as you could imagine: average intelligence, average looks, average ""popularity"" / social reception, below average artistic talent, not really gifted in any area / don't really excel at anything, etc.  I've had a very fortunate and cushy life.  I had what I would consider to be as perfect of a childhood (up to age 12ish) as someone could hope to have.  The only real ""inconvenience"" or ""unfortunate circumstance"" I've had to deal with in life is a father with what we believe is either Narcissistic Personality Disorder or Bipolar Disorder (or some combination of both), but obviously we would have no way of knowing from a clinical standpoint since he would NEVER visit anyone with the expertise to diagnose him.  Fittingly, he is COMPLETELY unaware of the way he is and the effect he has on people.  Obviously, I'm sure this has had some lasting impact on my mental stability, though I have no way of knowing how much of it contributes to my current predicament.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, I've been in and out of university for the last 4 years as a result of my depression, and I am currently living with my parents as I try to sort myself out before returning to school (and not doing a very good job at it).  At this stage of my life, I would probably consider the core of my problem to be a stereotypical sense of existential dread.  I can't stand the notion of spending the vast majority of life maintaining our survival (cooking, eating, sleeping, exercising, cleaning, commuting from place to place, etc.) and performing a menial set of tasks to actually provide the means to maintain our survival.  I understand that ""that's just what life is"", and I guess I'm not challenging that structure since there are billions of people that are okay with living it.  I have more of a problem with the unspoken obligation that we have to live out this structure of life (which we never chose to live, at least not that we remember \[if you're religious\]) all the way to it's natural end, even if you hate every second of it.  The majority of people can't seem to grasp the concept of not really wanting to go through the motions and endure all the tragedies of life for no real purpose, and therefore anyone who decides that this life is not really for them is considered ""sick"" and ""disordered.""  I wouldn't consider my actively suicidal, but the thought often comes to mind about how nice it would be ""take an exit"" so to speak.  I would say that there are three reasons why I haven't and will likely never commit suicide:  1) I could not bear to transfer my ""suffering"" to my mom, brother, and sister.  Unfortunately, they arbitrarily care about me to the degree that my death (especially by my own hand) would be incredibly hard to bear.  2) I fear the actual process of death, particularly the pain.  Obviously, some means would be quicker and less painful than others, but the idea of it naturally scares me.  3) Having been raised as a Christian, there is a part of me that is a bit fearful of the punishment I would receive on the other side if God does in fact exist.  But unfortunately, there is no third option.  It's either live life just for the arbitrary sake of living it and endure all the crap that goes along with it, or end it and make the people who love you suffer.  I feel like I'm in a state of limbo trying to choose between the two (even though I'm not actually contemplating suicide), and therefore have not progressed in the direction of either option.  My slow progression through university is likely a result of subconscious stalling since the REAL part of life (the monotonous and torturous part) begins as soon as I graduate.  And dreading the remainder of your life isn't exactly a motivator to ""improve yourself.""  So therefore, I'm pretty much stagnated and just wish more than anything that I could go back and live my childhood on an endless loop.

&amp;#x200B;

I realize that this thinking is ""distorted"", but it's not entirely illogical, making it seemingly difficult to refute.  I've seen several doctors, tried several medications (all with either imperceivable or detrimental results \[I am currently taking a combination of the ""imperceivable results"" variant\]), and done 4 stints of therapy (I'm doing therapy right now), but nothing has been successful in getting me going.  I understand that at some point, since I've already decided that I can't call it quits, I'll just have suck it up and grit my teeth through it for the sake of my family.  But ultimately, that moment doesn't have to happen RIGHT NOW, so why WOULD I care to do anything other than only what I actively want to do?

depression,"Hello. I am climbing out of a depression so severe that I think I may have actually been psychotic for a while. So I’ve been researching while also reading and posting here as part of my recovery process.

So imagine someone gets to the point where they have major depressive disorder (MDD). And for whatever reasons, they will always refuse treatment - I cannot open up in therapy or I don’t want pills to change me or the meds don’t work for me or . . . some other reason.

It seems to me that there are only three outcomes. One is that they kill themselves. Two is that the disease progresses to psychotic depression, so they keep having psychotic breaks and eventually end up homeless or in an institutional setting. Three is that their family steps in somewhere along the line and helps them cope, meaning that they are effectively institutionalized but by their families because they won’t ever get treatment and their family can care for them but not make them get treatment.

depression,"Hey guys and girls.

I have been lurking here for a while.

Now I felt like I just have to clear my head and write things down, and I couldn't think of a better safe space.

I am 32f, living Hungary, with kind if severe depression. I guess I have been depressed for way longer than I have acknowledged it.

Currently I don't have a job, for the last two years. I had a very very bad nervous breakdown period in my last job, working for the IT help desk of a big company. Looking back I see how horrible that actually was. At the time it felt kinda normal, and a natural continuation of how my mental health was deteriorating at the time.

I was regularly doing my job sitting among my coworkers with sunglasses on, to try to disguise the tears flowing down my face. Guess what. I couldn't. Some of my coworkers became friends. I was in an all male team. They admitted to had no clue how to help. Any time they asked how I was, I replied with a fake smile plastered to my face ""I'm okay.""

I've been doing this I'm okay stint for so long, I can't remember when it started. High school? Elementary?

My then boss (team leader, with no social skills, and still he insisted that he does not care about the technicalities of our work, because he is a ""people's manager, not an IT guy"") told me to ""get myself together, asked me for a meeting in a glass room - really, it was a little hole with one desk and 2 chairs behind a glass wall so EVERYONE on the floor could watch me break down and having a panic attack, not  being able to properly breath, and cry, and slide down to the floor with my back to the wall, when he accused me of not caring a bit about my job, because of being 1-2 minutes late almost every day. I had a pretty serious ankle injury at the time. When the elevators were overwhelmed in the morning, I had to wait for them because I couldn't walk up to the second floor. I know. I could have got there earlier. I couldn't. Depression, remember?

After this he agreed to try to help me and I promised to find a therapist as soon as possible. This was on a wednesday, and the next day  friend called and told me that they got me a miracle first appointment FOR FREE for friday, because a therapist they know had an appointment cancelled. It was at 5:30 pm I should have worked till 6. I went to my team lead, and told him happily that I got an appointment this fast, and I would like to get off an hour earlier on Friday, I will stay an hour longer today if it's possible.

He practically shouted at me, how do I even think that he would let me go with one day to cover me. See at this point I was not taking calls, but handling emails. I would not have said okay if I knew I would leave my colleagues in deep water. I also asked them if it would be okay, could they hold down the fort (we were a team of 5 instead of a team of 7-8, with unfilled positions, because so many people left so frequently because of this fine gentleman of a boss). They said obviously I should go, and they were happy for me to get help.

Obviously I got another panic attack right then and there. 

Thankfully the big boss from over his head noticed or got notified, and he was absolutely understanding. He told me to take a medical leave if I need it, and remember that my health is always a lot more important than a job.

He told me to go get therapy, come back in a month or so when the therapist says I can, and we see it from there, they will try to accommodate my needs into how much workload I get, and see what I can do easily, and not put me to do certain tasks.

I got medication, first time in my life. It helped some. The therapy did too. At that point I had money to go to.

In a month my little brother got married. I was still coming up on escitaloprame,which is a rollercoaster of emotions. I was crying the whole week how I don't feel like I can go, because I will ruin my brother's wedding, because I can't be happy. I went, and I could smile and be happy for bits of times, with bouts of crying outside, and only one panic attack.

At that point I had the option to get over to Vienna airport and fly to Mallorca, to attend my childhood best friend's wedding which she held on Sunday. I would have gotten back on Monday, and check in for work on Tuesday. My teamlead told me ""Don't even dream of it after missing the last month.""

I think that wasnot even when I quit. It took one more week of his bullshit. I went to the boss guy, and he told me to care for my health, and told me all he could do to help is to give me 3 months severance pay to help me get back on my feet.

I remember him fondly, and as the only humane person in the management of that company. Well, the money is long gone, I am struggling to pay for therapy, which I did not have for a year. 

I have dreams. I want to help people with mental health issues, make them being heard in an environment that does not take us for people because we cannot contribute to their cruel society.

Currently I guess i live below the poverty line. I don't know. Does having about 85 usd for a month, and same for my boyfriend count? He also has SEVERE depression, (he is starting to deal with the fact that he has severe ptsd too) he is unmedicated because he is not covered anymore by our government healthcare system, because he didn't have a documented job for a while and he couldn't keep up paying the monthly checks. He worked in tourism and they payed him in cash. Which is really really not unusual here.

I have a flat. Which is also a lot less unusual here, couple decades back I think almost 80-90% of people were home owners. East block post-ussr I guess.

My dad bought it to me taking out a loan based on some money he started to put on an account when I was in kindergarten. He is currently paying the interests to the bank for another two years (because he took some of the money under my name and put it towards a flat for his wife's daughter, so she would be able to take over paying it earlier. hers is 83 usd a month, mine is 283). And he pays our bills. Which is a lot, but I AM thankful for having shelter and electricity and running water. So that is good. What I don't have is basic understanding of my condition and seemingly any will on his side to understand it. He refused to pay for therapy though, and he mocked me for my nervous breakdown/panic attack while he was very drunk when we last visited in March. I believe if I had the opportunity to continue my therapy in March, I would already be way ahead and would not need his financial support anymore. I feel so ashamed for getting money from him, and still being angry for not getting more. But I feel completely left alone.

Now I don't observe the nice custom of breakfast. It is a good day when we have two meals. My mom (they are divorced and not on good terms) drops off basic foodstuff every other week.

I still have to buy bread and milk every couple days (1 liter of milk and a loaf of bread costs about 2usd). We get by on friends bringing over chicken wings or potatoes for french fries and we cook it together, having a dinner. They are lifesavers, and I am so grateful to have them.

In February I was lucky enough to get into a one month schema therapy program, the only one in the country. I tried to apply last august. It took some time.

It helped me tremendously, and I got mood-stabilizer on top of my previous medication, and they diagnosed me with light bipolar disorder too.

They said I came a long way, and with continued weekly therapy I will be able to hold down a job soon and get better.

The thing is, we (in Hungary) do not have free therapy provided by national healthcare. I've heard legends about people who got it, but it's like one doc for about a thousand mental health patients.

One therapy costs on average here in the capital about 40 dollars. I got lucky and found a foundation where they offer it for people without stable income for 20. Woohoo. My mom pays for it weekly, I started it again in August. Her income is less than half of what it were before corona. But during the summer our relationship got way better and I think she started to understand my situation better, and she really tries to help and she *listens*.

I was always afraid to tell people about my problems, as I feel they are invalid, and they think I am just lazy, or I just can't pull myself up by my bootstraps. I am ashamed for being *hungry*. I am ashamed for not being able to hold down a job. I have panic attacks just thinking about going to a job interview, and getting in, and breaking down the first day or something.

I want to sell my flat. And move outside of the city, and start to build a community where people who have problems are welcome. I feel powerless though. Even if I listed the flat on a website, most of the times I cannot pick up the phone, because I got so worked up by very pushy realtors calling, and I cannot know if it's a prospective buyer, or another one of THEM. I also can't clean up the flat enough that I would feel comfortable showing it to anyone without being apologetic and representing myself confidently as the owner without getting less money for the flat because I look like I can be pushed around because of my mental state.

I don't want that extra money for myself. I want to buy a chunk of land close to the city with good , and build small and affordable houses. Plural. Invite my friends who go to college and can't afford to get a flat and living with their abusive parents still at 24 or something. Or my friends closer to 30, who have a well paying job, but spend about 3/4 of it on renting a flat and bills. When these people are gone I'm sure I'll find people who need the roof over their heads.

I would like to mentor local kids, help them get a better education. I want to help people getting to understand that their mental health problem does not make them less of a human. I want to be part of a community where we help each other. I really really don't want to have a lot. I want to have enough to live with dignity, and have some to share with others.

I have been living with depression for half of my life ... And it has been on going even though I can spend a year ""seemingly fine"" and then I crash ... One of those crashes was at the start of quarantine

Anyway by March I got kinda sick of doing  nothing (I do nothing usually so not much had changed) so I started a fan account to help me cope with my depression and the fan page was for my most favorite band in the world... You may have heard of them ... The Beatles

I felt suicidal and depressed the whole time with many times cutting myself and crying myself to sleep ... (If he knew) the crying much to the dissapoint of my father because boys have to be strong... Well I'm not a boy than am I

Anyway a week into my fan account I believe April 5 I messaged my best friend for the first time we will call her m 

After another week I remember a fan/personal account that blocked me on my personal for some reson so I used this account to talk to them and his name is f (we are best friends too)

Then I cant remember the exact date or time or anything but I messaged another girl named j. (if they see this they know exactly who I am) 

Anyway over the last 6 months I have become closer with them than my own father bc they understand me

Anyway I'm from Australia and they all live in the general area of us 

And I said as soon as I graduate school at year 12 I am going to fly to America and we are going to do a road trip across the us so we can hang out for a month as like a ""time to find ourselves"" but I just want to meet them

Over these 6 months my grades have slipped from barely c (standard) to d- (well below standard) bc half the school year has been quarantine but dad refuses to believe that is the reason why and that my phone is to blame

I feel my phone is going to be taken away call me a snowflake or whatever the fuck you want but my phone is the only reason im happy

I'm affraid that if it gets taken away that's it for me... I'll end up cutting more and harder and that will be it I'm done y'know and call me an attention seeker I want to live and the current reason I'm alive is them and if I lose that well I have no reason to live

depression,"Warning: suicidal thoughts

So to start the story, I got diagnosed with depression last year on New Year's Day (what a great way to start of a new year) because my sister convinced my parents to take me to the therapist. My sister went back to uni so I was left alone again and every time sometimes, myvparents used to say stuff like ""If only you'd listen to us and you just study well, you won't have all this depression and stuff"" and ""this is a waste of time and money"" which genuinely made me feel guilty for even going for therapy. I started taking meds and my parents assumed I was fine bc I took meds but I decided not to tell them anything and deal with everything on my own.

A couple months later, I got my first anxiety attack I but I didn't know it was an anxiety attack u til I had my second one on a school trip when my friend, who also has anxiety attacks, explained to me that I most probably could be having an anxiety attack. Since i started having anxiety attacks, I decided to go to the school counsellor since even my friends were telling me to go to the school counsellor. So, I did.

Now, I feel like I've made the worst decision in my life. It's been almost a year since I started going for counselling in school and I got slightly suicidal after I got my SAT scores bc it's the only thing I studied for during the whole summer. I had so many breakdowns and I feel like put my mental health on the line for nothing because I didn't get the score my parents or I wanted. I talked to my counsellor and he was really worried and he started this procedure where basically he talks with my parents.

I didn't tell my parents at all that I was going for counselling over the past year but when I finally did, they took it really badly and my dad was like ""I'm not going to send you to uni like your sister"" and then my mom started praising what a ""good girl"" my sister is bc she tells them everything. My dad refused to speak to the counsellor so I was like ok. My sister was on cl with me bc I asked her to be there and when she started speaking to my parents, she started saying that she told me to tell mom and dad about it. I felt kinda betrayed bc I thought she would support me but she just insisted that she told me to tell them. I swore at my sister (on chat) but then I got in trouble for that because we respect our elders in our culture (not saying that other cultures don'tbut you can't swear at people who are older). I never thought my mental health would get so bad to the point that I had to tell my parents.

Then, my mom said ""Your sister stopped going to counselling in uni bc she realized that she may not get the certificates that she wanted."" I was really confused and I asked my sister (by text) whybshe didn't tell me about the certificates thing and she said that she couldn't come up with an example at that point. Now, she says that I won't get 'extra responsibilities' in school like being a leader or something like that because my counsellor would tell my teachers.

I am so mad at myself for even going to counselling now. What if I don't get to do what I want in school just because someone underestimates me because I'm not in a great place mentally right now? What if I don't get into a good uni? Recently, I've just been feeling like I would be much better off dead and I most probably should've died when I was young so I don't have to be a burden. I feel like my mom is trying to help with the anxiety and all but I still feel that she's highly misinformed on so much stuff but it's hard to explain anything to them because I'm pretty sure I'll get dismissed because sometimes they tend to have the ""I'm older so I know better"" mentality.

I just don't want to do anything and I would rather live in my imaginary world tbh. It's a much better place. I don't like anything about this life. I feel like a failure in everything and I just feel like not living (not really commit s****de but just a feeling where I just don't feel like living). I just feel like.my whole life has been a mistake and I feel guilty for living bc maybe someone else would've been more grateful and actually used this body to it's fullest potential if I wasn't born.

I feel like I always hit her up to FaceTime and she never hits me up. My sister lives in town but she’s always too busy and tired to hang out. I’m always the one that asks her to hang out and I feel like I’m bothering her. I feel like she only entertains me sometimes because she’s afraid I might kill myself. It feels like pulling teeth to get the people closest to me to hang out with me. I’ve basically grown apart from all of my friends during quarantine. I have nobody left.
I’m living with these girls I met on the college Facebook page. They’re nice and they ask me to hang out sometimes but I feel like it’s because they pity me. They’re also already friends with each other so I always feel awkward. I want to hang out with my old friends but I feel like I’m bothering them. We also haven’t really talked in so long.

I’ve tried handing out resumes and calling places and nothing is working. Im graduating this year so I’m also anxious about not getting a job after college. I keep applying to internships and clubs and getting nothing. I feel like a failure bc all I do is sleep all day and miss my classes and I never finish all my homework. 

I feel really jealous of my roommate because she has a job, a boyfriend, friends to hang out with, and extracurriculars. Whenever she goes out to do something I feel like a loser just rotting in bed. I’m worried that she’s annoyed I’m always in the room or something. Or that she feels bad bc she thinks I have no friends. She’s nice and I like her but it just sucks to see somebody live life perfectly right next to me while I feel like I’m rotting away. I wish I lived alone so I could just cry all day in peace and not feel judged.

I just want one thing to make my life feel like it’s worth living. I feel so lonely. I feel like my whole life is just a loneliness. I’m dreading going to sleep and waking up and spending another day alone, just like all the other days. I’ve never had a boyfriend and I’m trying not to wait on a relationship to make me happy but it’s hard. I feel like if I just had somebody to talk to about what I’m going through, I would feel better. I feel like I’ll be single forever and I’m not handling being alone very well right now. I think about suicide so often it’s getting scary. I wouldn’t do it because I’m scared but when I’m thinking about it, it’s like a desperate need.

After this I spend one night in a hospital and was discharged after that night.

depression,"I’m so stressed and anxious about life that I barely sleep and I have barely any motivation to do anything. 
The reason I’m like this is because of three goals I set myself that have yet to be accomplished. I’m beginning to doubt they ever will be. 

Goal one was to find a part time job. With the pandemic jobs in my city have been limited especially now that we are in a second lockdown and certain industries are closed. I’ve applied to two jobs and haven’t gotten interviews for either yet and it’s making me think somethings wrong with me that I can’t even get an interview for a retail store or grocery store. 

Goal number 2 is to graduate and get into the university I applied to. I haven’t gotten a response yet but some people have known for a week. My grades aren’t the highest so it’s likely I won’t get in to my first choice and I have a slightly higher chance at my second but still no guarantee. I need to get into university because my parents want that for me and I don’t see myself working full time yet. 

Last goal was to make friends. I don’t have any friends at all. I had class friends before the pandemic hit but I haven’t spoken to any since June. School is also online this semester so it’s harder to meet people and also like I said before we’re in a second lockdown so not many places to meet people. I hoped a part time job would help me make friends but at this point I’m still jobless.

depression,"My way of writing is a bit convoluted so sorry about that but bear with me here and I know this subreddit might not be the right one for this but I really don't know where else to talk about this. I've been feeling really really bad related to this topic since some time- I'm not too well versed with communities on Reddit and talking to a friend only resulted in him calling me a pussy and shit so I don't know where else to put this.

So...

Recently me and a friend of mine started working out; we live in different cities but talk about it often. But the thing is I've recently been feeling really depressed with myself because of how fast she was progressing at first and now she is getting stronger than I am. This never really affected me at all if it was a guy. But for some reason this thing is just making me feel really low.

The pandemic already had started giving my really low lows and coupled with how obese if become it was getting worse but for some reason this thing just pinched me in a way I can't describe.

It can be because the things she's saying she can do right now- I used to do more. I was a national level shot put player and I focused mostly on strength training and my friend; she's able to pull through 2 sets of 50 reps of dumbell curls with 7.5 kg dumbells on both her arms. She has gone from lifting basically nothing to this much in 2 months time. And while I used to do the same amount before, after the pandemic and lockdown I just let everything go and ended up gaining almost 20 kilos. And honestly it makes me feel horrible. But the thing is such an inferiority complex never happen to me when a male friend of mine talks about his workouts because I do have friends who lift more than her- (we're all 17 yr olds). When she first told me she was able to life an amount more than I could- it really shattered me for some reason and I went on crying for so long because- I don't even know why I felt so bad. This is the first time that I've had such a feeling and I'm not really able to articulate it very well.

The summary of this convoluted post is that- while I know I can and eventually might start lifting more than her and get stronger than her, I just feel like shit whenever I think about how much she can lift right now and how much she improved. And I don't think it's only because she is a girl. I know huge female bodybuilders exist but- I guess it's because I personally know this girl that it makes me feel so bad.

depression,"Hello. I come heee because I'm struggling during mknths with depression. I have this illness since May. I was a huge fan of DeviantArt website. But then something horrible happened. The whole DA staff want to switch DA design to Eclipse. Many users where mad about these news, and then the protests in website began. It was called «Sound of Silence». But unfortunately, protests where failed. Many people signed the petition and what we get? Nothing? Staff don't want to hear us. And then they changed DA forever.

This was bad, and I becomed depressed. 2020 is already a horrible year because of Coronavirus and other bad things. I watched news and see how many bad things are happening in the world. Economical crisis, protests in Belarus, SJWs, the chaos in USA, 

Is this world is ruled by forces by Evil? Why forces of Good are always lose? Does the God exist? If he exists, does he is good or just a horrible jerk, who want just to make people suffer?

I don't want to kill myself. Instead, I want to kill other people in the world. No, I WANT TO DESTROY THIS FUCKING WORLD BY MY HANDS!!! These people should be killed because of their sins! And only by destroying the Earth I can end humanity's suffering! This world sucks so I want to make Apocalypse scenario true!!! Why we must to make the world better, if everything we love will be destroyed? Why we should to fight for good if forces of Good always fail, and Evil is always winning.

depression,"So, I'm diagnosed with Depression and Anxiety (18M). I felt this way for several years now, occasionally getting better or worse. I was always kind of a hypochondriac and was convinced of having eye disease, heart disease and recently mental disease. I worry very often if my Depression is just a sign of a developing Psychosis. I've always felt a bit ""different"", have ""weird"" thoughts and interests that others dont have. That can be related to my giftedness, which can be a very bad thing... 

So the reason I worry about Psychosis is because of certain symptoms that come when Im very depressed :
- Derealization
- Confusion
- Tiredness
- slight Anxiety
- slight Paranoia (Ive had that since my childhood)
- Fear of getting insane
- Feeling detached from reality, like a bad dream
- Memory confusion
- Nostalgia and Deja Vus
- Difficulty concentrating and following the speech of others
- worrying about wether my perceptions are real or not
(I hear a noise and go check if it is real or not) 

It happened yesterday when I drove with my mom to a place I have never been before. I didn't like it, because it was a remote and (for me) depressing village. I get confused at places like this. I live in a certain ""intellectual world"" of my own. When I get out into places that contradict my inner world, I will get very confused, confused about where I am and start to dissociate from reality.

I'm just waiting everyone's time and resources. They say they care. But what if they don't mean it. What if they're just saying it cause they have to. All I'm ever doing is making problems. My family would be better off without me. Heck, the more the age gap gets mentioned the more I think maybe I was never meant to be here in the first place. Life for my family will have been much better without me. And I unloaded on Ellen. What kind of friend am I? Burdening her with my problems or issues. She's busy and occupy with her own life problems she has her own stuff to deal with. What right do I have to pile up on her more? Tenshi and JJ would be better off without me. The clan is dead.

depression,"I made a post on this subreddit a couple weeks ago and got a couple private messages that seemed really genuine and kind. These people said they were there for me if I ever needed anyone to talk to and things like that. Then we started to talk and I thought we were becoming friends. After a while one of them asked me if I could talk somewhere else more private, and suggested Hangouts (which is an email chat). I didn’t really think much of it at first and agreed to chat with them there. Then they asked me to send a picture of myself (which I refused to do), after that we just continued chatting normally again. Then after a couple days, they told me they needed help with something, I asked what they needed help with, and they asked me if I could buy a gift for them, they also said I could do it with a shopping card or though Amazon or eBay. Apparently their friend was getting married and they couldn’t afford to buy a gift for them, and that I was the only one who could help them. They also said that the wedding would be held this weekend (creating a sense of urgency), and that they were really counting on me. I told them I needed to think about it, and went directly to Scamwatch which really helped me identify that I was in fact trying to get scammed. 

I think this subreddit is a pretty easy way for scammers to take advantage of someone because most of us here feel sad and lonely, and just want someone to talk to (meaning our defences are down, which can make us pretty gullible). 

For your own protection:

Never send money to someone you haven’t met in person.

Always consider the possibility that the approach may be a scam, particularly if the warning signs appear. Try to remove the emotion from your decision making no matter how caring or persistent the person is.

If someone sends you a photo of themselves, do an image search of them to help determine if they really are who they say they are. You can use image search services such as Google or TinEye.

Be alert to things such as spelling and grammar mistakes, inconsistencies in their stories and other signs.

Be very cautious when sharing pictures and videos of yourself especially when you’ve never met them before. (Scammers can use this for blackmail) 

Be wary of requests for money. Never send money or give credit card details, online account details, or copies of important personal documents to anyone you don’t know or trust.

depression,"I just want to give up. Everything feels pointless. Okay, I could try to drag myself out of this fucking black hole yet again but for what? Honestly, really honestly, what is there to live for? The few friends I have barely give a fuck about me, never text first, don’t reply even when I’m clearly struggling, only think about themselves. I hardly speak to my family because they’ve all got their own shit going on - when I try to tell anyone how much I’m struggling they just do the usual “aw sorry to hear, here if you need me”. But it’s like - I need you NOW, this is it, this is the bit where I’m reaching out and all you give is limp platitudes. My boyfriend just gets frustrated with me and starts slamming things about and snapping at me saying “well if you can’t be bothered...” when I just don’t have the energy any more to make certain decisions or have certain conversations. What’s wrong, he asks me over and over, what’s happened? Nothing really - something small “set me off” and then it’s like I’m sucked down into this whirlpool I can’t get myself out of. He knows how much shouting and displays of impatience/frustration upset me but he still does it, like he wants me to feel worse. I Can’t stop crying. Can’t focus on anything. Everything feels like too much effort and, as I said, what the fuck is the point of trying anyway? My life is a boring, bland, bleak trudge. I’m ungrateful of the things I have, the home I own, the people in my life. I know I’m a whiney miserable depressing person to be around. I know my failures are all due to my own laziness and fear. I’m so sick of feeling this way all the fucking time. I’m so sick of anxiety controlling me physically and depression holding me down mentally. I’ve a headache from crying. I’ve shut myself downstairs out of my boyfriends way so that I’m not annoying him by being so upset. I really really want to hurt myself, have been fighting the urge since yesterday. Ended up snapping my hair bands on my wrists which sort of helped but left some raised marks which I got scared of my boyfriend seeing because he’d freak out and make it a much bigger thing. People who haven’t self harmed don’t understand how calming it is, how much it helps. I know I mustn’t do it but god I want to so much. Just need to feel that calm nice light feeling for just a minute. I’ve started “therapy” and it’s such a joke - 20 minutes with some young trainee who doesn’t know what the fuck she’s doing and just goes “oh no” when I tell her stuff, like I’m making her nervous by revealing too much.

The dream ends with me walking into my kitchen and going up to the pantry. I grab a large jar of peanut butter and set it on the counter.

I wouldn't be allowed out with my friends. I wasn't allowed to whisper in the house. She'd check my phone every night, skimming through my messages and shit. She'd read my diary too. 

I had no privacy.

So I used to hide beneath my bed most of the time and listen to music. And I used to draw under the wooden boards of my bed and write secrets and poems and crappy song lyrics. For years it was my safe space.

She obviously found out about it. But that's a story for another time, I guess.

I'm much older now. I live with my Aunt. And I understand now that the reason for her bizarre behaviour is her mental illness. And for a long time I'd forgotten about the stuff I'd written under my bed in that old house.

Until today.

My cousin recently moved into my old bedroom at my mom's house. He's been cleaning up the place and he likes to send me pictures of old toys and little nicknacks that he finds around the house.

And today I just got a dozen or so pictures of all the little secrets I'd written under my bed for myself.

It was utterly humiliating and I've been feeling like absolute shit since I got those messages. I can't help but feel like it's my fault that he found it. Like I shouldn't have written anything under there in the first place. Like I should have covered it all up with paint when I moved out. I didn't know what he thought of me now because of it. If anybody else had seen it. I don't know what the fuck I'm supposed to do about it.

I’ve always loved him though but at times I know I didn’t cherish him the way I should’ve. He’s felt the same towards me but at the moment it’s kinda complicated.

He’s barely talking to me, mostly just being civil, because I’m part of the cause on why he got arrested recently for a Class A Misdemeanor Family Violence. We had just ended up getting into a huge altercation and stuff. I never meant to make this all happen. Just had been egging him on about things by showing him how much I care for him when he had been upset that day.
Cops treated him like an aggressor and me the victim but it was more closer to being an equal fight. And the cops wouldn’t have come if his sister hadn’t called 911 for help...

So now he has a no contact order issued as part of his bond agreement, meaning we can’t see or talk to each other until it’s all resolved, but we’ve found a way to chat. But right now I have separation anxiety and fear of missing out, amongst other things. He only appears to be kinda missing me here and there but no where near as much as me.
He doesn’t want to really stay with me after this case gets resolved, so it’s really hurting me on the inside.

I told him his case is gonna get dropped based on certain factors, but if I had to, I would take the fall for him and would even go to jail instead because life without him is meaningless.

depression,"The only place I feel safe and even somewhat normal is home, in my room and alone. I go to work everyday, I almost never call out. But if I could afford not to, I wouldn't work.

I always feel like people that work around me are talking about me behind my back and I'm constantly afraid that even people who act nice to me, really hate me. I try to go out of my way to be nice, but fear even that is driving people away. I think, ""Do they think I'm being nice because I want something?"" I'm almost 40, I've only ever had one VERY bad relationship that lasted 2 years and I'm afraid to even try and ask a woman out because nowadays even asking can be considered harassment. I have zero friends, even online. I don't make enough money to do much more than pay for my car insurance and phone and chip in 400 bucks a month toward bills so I live with my friggin' parents. I was on my own for a few years back around 2000, but got laidoff from a great paying job and lost almost everything when the unemployment ran out. About the only person, (other than of course my parents) that even talks to me outside of work is one of my nieces. But even then, I have to initiate conversation. Since she is the only one who really talks to me, I want to ask her for help, but I'm afraid to. I am just flat out afraid to ask for the help I need. I am even having trouble typing this because of the fear of being picked on or teased for my issues. I have anger issues that are resulting from bottling up all my emotions all the time. I swing from pretending to be happy at work to halfway through the shift going silent and just trying to focus on the task so I don't have to feel the crushing depression wave coming over me.

depression,"My depression is relapsing, I can just feel it. Can’t deny it or try to ignore it anymore, nor should I be doing that in the first place. Nothing I can really do about it though since that’s always been my experience so I might as well just embrace everything fading away for the nth time by now.

Everything’s slowly getting gray again, less and less energy to do what I need to to the point where even basic self-care is now going down the drain, so tired all the time, body’s hurting even more than it already does, keep forgetting important things, suicidal more and more frequently to the point where it’s now nearly every day. It always comes back, seemingly worse every time. It never, EVER goes away. I guess I was completely ignorant to actually believe that for the first time in my life, everything would finally be ok and maybe even stay that way because of the massive amount of progress I’ve made in the last couple of months, but as always, I’m now back to where I was before and the worst part is that nothing even happened to set all of this off; this is just how it is for me, how it’s been for as long as I can remember.

I’ve been suicidal on and off for six years straight now and have come to accept that after two failed attempts which have physically maimed me for the rest of my life (yet I still want to try again now more than ever), three stays at the psych ward, dozens of calls to hotlines, 10+ therapists and psychiatrists who’ve never really been able to get through to me and over a dozen failed antidepressants that only ever made me feel worse when I was on them, I’ve come to accept the fact that I’m just one of those people in this world who simply cannot be saved.

That last statement reminds me of a scene that I’ve never been able to forget from *The Walking Dead* where a young woman pulls a knife out on Rick (the character who comes across her) and, thinking that she wants to kill him, he unholsters his gun and aims it at her but is shocked when she instead points the knife at her own chest and before he can do anything, she stabs herself and quickly bleeds out. Rick cries and goes back to his camp where his group of survivors are at to tell an old man there named Hershel about what happened and Hershel says to him that sadly, there are just some people in this world who can’t be saved no matter how hard you try. Despite how much I used to love that show before the depression took that away from me too like it has with nearly everything else in my life, it never really dawned on me exactly why I resonated with that scene so much up until quite recently when I realized that nowadays, I feel exactly like that woman: someone with nothing of any real value left to live for who, despite someone’s best intentions and efforts, is ultimately unable to be saved in the end because she just wants her suffering to finally stop for good.

This has gone on for too long, too intensely and with far too many things to list that have never really helped me feel any better for me to be able to reach any other logical conclusion. I just have this ominous feeling in the pit of my stomach that somehow, some way, I’m going to die soon and honestly, that’s ok with me. I used to cry about it, used to be angry and upset that this fucking disease stole my entire life away from me but now, I just don’t really care anymore. Hell, even as I’m typing this all out now, I’m just blankly staring at my screen, emotionless and devoid of any real feelings whatsoever. I’m ready to go and just want the calming embrace of death to finally take me away from this hellish nightmare of a life that’s only ever brought me misery, disappointment and an ungodly amount of pain. It’s very clear to me that this will only continue to get worse as that’s been the pattern for a long, long time now so really, what’s the point in deluding myself into thinking that everything will be fine when instinctually, I know that that’s just about the furthest thing from the truth and that I have NEVER been ok?

I can’t live the rest of my life like this, I REFUSE to. The only real comfort I have anymore is in the thought that at any time and with any method of my choosing, this sick, twisted game can all just end for good and I can finally sleep forever. While I don’t like the thought of leaving behind the people who care about me the most to pick up the pieces after I’m gone and mourn a loss that they’ll realistically never get over, I also can’t live only for them any longer and have decided that an entire lifetime ruined by an inability to feel happy or satisfied for even a moderate amount of time is too heavy of a burden for me to bear any longer.

I used to wish that it could’ve been different but I’ve come to accept that you can’t change the shitty hand you’ve been dealt so whether I like it or not, this is just how it is. No one beats the house either and I’m done deluding myself into thinking that I’m somehow a special exception to that universal rule. Lost nearly all my chips I started out with that are now in the other guy’s towering stack, the crowd cheering me on has now all but disappeared and I’m looking at a 2-7 offsuit hand up against a pair of aces. Might as well just fold, cut my losses while I still can and leave the table to never lose ever again after that’s really all I’ve ever done.

depression,"I've felt like this for basically as long as I can remember, I saw councilors/doctors for several years about my depression and none of it helped, I actually got significantly worse over that period. Anti-depressants never helped at all. The few times I do feel a bit better just highlight how bad I always feel. I think about killing myself constantly and I really wish I could do it but I've had these feelings for so long I know I can't get up the courage to do it.

I don't think I've ever had a really meaningful friendship, in elementary school I had one friend who I would hang out with outside of school, that's probably the closest I've ever got. In high school there was not a single person I've did stuff with outside of school more then once or twice. I remember there was this group of six guys that I would always sit next to in class, we were all nerdy and would talk a joke and stuff. But, they would always talk about going over to one of their houses after school to do something and they never invited me. Looking back I know they probably would have let me come along if I asked but they never once offered.

I had one friend after high school that I had met during then, but, we weren't really close until we finished HS. But, I've always felt like he neglected me. He would tell me that he loves me like a brother and then ignore me for six months, he even once said that he could drop all his other friends 'like that' but I was the only one he couldn't. I remember once when we hanged out after not seeing each other for a very long time he told me that he was just way too busy and then like half an our later he causally mentioned that he had been hanging out with a friend of his. I would also tell him about how depressed I was that I've never had a gf and then he would brag all the time about all the women he had sex with and he even once forced me to watch a video of him getting a blowjob. The penis wasn't visible, you could see the woman's head, he did a face that he thought was supposed to be funny.

In university, other then that guy, the only 'friends' I've had have been people from clubs or classes and none of those have lasted. I almost never did anything outside of clubs/school. There even were a few people who I thought might turn out to be real friendships but all of them ended up ignoring me. It's always the same shit with everyone, if I want to do anything with them I need to initiate every single time, they never invite me out to do something.

Even worse is how nice everyone is to me, they always say that I am so smart and interesting and funny. I remember I was at this one place last year where one of the clubs I went to a lot hanged out and I was chatting with this girl I had a crush on and afterwards she went up to some other girl and said 'have you met anon, he's so cool.' And I remember just smiling and feeling dead inside, because I knew she didn't really mean it.

And the worst part, I know I just kinda suck, I know I'm a broken person. Some people are just the failed end of evolution and that's probably me.

I don't even want to get into how fucked my career prospects are, that's a whole different rant.

I was on leave for a little over a month and I hoped to be productive within that time, but like I expected- I ended up staying in bed for what seems like 60% of the time. We also recently moved into a new home and my fiancé’s been picking up my slack when it comes to house chores even though i know he comes home tired from working long shifts at the hospital. Lately it’s just been really hard finding a reason to do anything at all. I’ve been in and out of a pretty harsh depression for the past couple of years and my fiancé’s been so understanding and kind to me about it. I wanted to thank him by making him breakfast before work.

We didn’t have coffee filters, so I went to the only store near me open at 6am to get that and some creamer. I was surprised I actually got the courage to walk out the door at 5:30am with pitch black, eerie streets, a similar parking lot, then the walk from my car to the store, then back, then the walk from my car to my front door... my paranoia was kicking in, but I actually did it. Alone!! 

I know it’s not something extravagant or hard, but this is the first time in what seems like a long time where I decided to do something and actually finished it. And it was really nice to sit down and enjoy each other’s company before he went to work. 

Truth be told, the main reason I actually thought to do this was because I wasn’t able to sleep.

depression,"I'm still here. I don't know if I feel alive but I'm still here on this stupid space rock. I suppose I should be grateful, but I just feel stupid. I'm supposed to be dead and I don't find comfort in the fact that I survived myself. Because I am myself. I feel weak for staying alive and not being able to defeat myself.

Most of all I feel confused. I don't know what I want. I used to want to die so very badly. Anxiety, depression, who knows what else. Drug problems. Meds that make me feel numb. Too much else. Too much to remember. 

I don't know if any of this is real. I don't know if something exists beyond this life, and it scares me. I've always envisioned death through ones own doing to be like diving into a deep black expanse, an ocean of nothing. Everything ticking inside me slowly stops. Maybe quickly. Maybe painfully.

But what if there's something else I have to endure? After all this shit I have to wake up again except this time it's not another day of slipping in and out of reality its a whole new reality. I have to do everything again and more.

I'm probably wrong though. Everything will probably just stop. Or I'll go to hell.

I don't know if I care. I can't put into words how I feel. Something like terrible but so much worse. So much deeper and rustier. Sharper and twisty. Like some broken metal festering in my chest between sinew and splinters of bone. But the pain isn't physical it's in my head.

I'm losing it a bit now. It's 12:21am as a write this. I'm in my room, lying down staring at this screen. The air around me feels devoid of life yet somehow filled with pressure. Like a pause menu right before the action starts. I'm just... waiting.

I could have died so many times this year. Because of myself and otherwise, but mostly myself. I could have died so many times in my life. Because of myself and otherwise, but again, mostly myself.

But I'm still here and now I'm reading what could be your final words. I feel scared and dead. I feel that maybe I've already died. I can't tell what's real, which normally convinces me to harm myself or try and do something stupid, but now it convinces me you aren't real. 

But you have to be. And you're going to leave me behind. 

What's the point. I don't want to watch everyone leave. I feel so... I can't describe it. Close to death.

I'm weak. I can't handle this. I am going to try and help as much as I can but I'm just not strong enough. 

I love the people in my life and I know there are people I have yet to meet that I could end up loving too. But they're killing me. I'm watching them die without knowing why. I don't know what's wrong with me but it's too much to cope with most of the time. I try and carry everyone I can but my arms aren't big or strong enough.

depression,"I feel like my friends have betrayed me, my boyfriend doesn't like me anymore and would rather spend time with his friends and all I do is work and sleep and wish my life would end.

My friend just left her abusive boyfriend about a month ago and she is going through a phase where she has to be liked by every man she sees in order to build her self-confidence back. She also has to sleep with them apparently. I've started feeling like this has begun to include my boyfriend of 7 years and I'm uncomfortable with them together because I feel like  she is trying something and my boyfriend isn't exactly shutting it down like I would if the roles were reversed.
He has started to have a wandering eye too though he denies it and I don't want to push this issue anymore. After 7 years he has suddenly started going out on the weekends and drinking which he never used to do.
All of this has sent me into a raging depression that I can't get myself out of... I feel ugly, fat, unloved, different and difficult.
I am completely over people, I feel like everyone is a trash person just looking for the next person to sleep with, like the people around me have become animals and all they care about is men, women, sex, drugs... I can't find a normal person to talk to, I don't want to talk about sex and drugs and I'm afraid I'm going to lose my boyfriend because I'm not good enough for him.

depression,"Ive been struggling with depression my whole life i guess

Lately it's been really really bad tho. I have been at home for the last 7 months due to my work shutting down due to the virus. Got dumped and shit all over by my ex 3 months before corona. I have 2 friends, one i would call a REAL friend. My REAL friend has a boyfriend so i dont see or hear her much. Cant blame her cause i forgot the existence and importance of friends when i was in my 2 year shitty relationship so i bought that all on me. The other friend same thing. So im home 7/7 and im lucky if i can fill 2 days in the week with seeing people. 

I struggle with anxiety pretty bad as well so its not like i can quickly make more friends, i fucking hate people, well, actually not people but i hate the way i feel when im around people so i tend to avoid cause whats the point in feeling alone and stupid and like no one can understand you when surrounded by people. Lately i wake up with anxiety and it follows me through the day. Cant seem to get rid of it. 

Anyway 

doesnt matter

Im ashamed to say i probably spend 4 or 5 months just doing nothing, in bed. Doesnt matter if i wake up around 8am or at noon, i wont get out of bed before 3 pm. Then i will probably clean my room and get back into bed ha. 

Some days i cook for my family and that gives me some purpose that day i guess, like i achieved something. 

I started an art project on my wall, i really like doing it but most of the days i just stare at it. If i manage to keep it up for an hour i probably will paint till its 2-3 am no problem but then i have to have the energy to get out of bed to begin with. When i feel this depressed as now i can deal with some selfdesctructive thoughts and behaviour. I smoke so much weed all day every day, till the point of just numbing my every thought. I like to drink alone cause at least it makes me not give a shit about anything. Yesterday i drank pretty much a whole bottle of wine, and i have bought a couple of rum bottles before that never lasts more than 2 days, even if i drink alone. 

I couldnt get out of bed anymore and i had NO energy for nothing, so i went to the doctor and asked for some ritalin (i said i had bigtime trouble concentrating, which IS true, i got diagnosed with ADD around the age of 9 or something) . Started crushing and snorting the pills. Which made me somewhat more energised but i still felt dead inside. Painted a bit. Drank. Smoked. Took some xanax. This went on for a week or 2. Ofcourse now i feel even more depressed and anxious, too depresssed to even get out of bed to smoke, dont even feel like smoking and thats a weird thing for me. 

Ive only ever once felt suicidal in my life, even tho ive been through a lot. That was a year ago, in my relationship, feeling so alone i felt like it wouldnt matter anymore if i jumped of that building, or took those big knifes from work to slit my wrists. I honestly just didnt care anymore. 

Im starting to feel like that again. I have no purpose anymore and im sick of it. I just got a tattoo and that was the highlight from this year. Now i just want to tattoo everything i want as soon as possible cause at least i have a feeling i DID something, even if its only getting ready and leaving my house to the shop. 

Havent self harmed in years but i constantly have to stop myself from doing something stupid. I wanna make an appointment with my therapist who i havent seen in years but im scared. Mostly cause my mood switches just so much, today i really wanna die but next week maybe i just wont care, the week after that maybe ill even enjoy life (for a moment or 2 lol) and after that probably buy too much of everything i dont need and watch porn nonstop and go on dates cause why not. 

Im feeling stuck right now and i dont even know what im trying to achieve with this post. Maybe i just want to vent cause i feel like i have nobody that truly cares about me this point in my life.",I simply cannot get out of bed anymore,Yeahhhhhwhatever

depression,"(17F) i turn 18 in less than a week, and ive been really depressed lately but i could never wrap my finger around it, but all my thoughts had a common recurring theme when i tried to understand my feelings of hurt. a little background: i have undiagnosed schizophrenia, and self harming/suicidal tendencies my whole life, and ive asked to get therapy, school counselor also suggested therapy to my parents and both of them arent happy with the idea of it. my parents are divorced and i live with my father because my mom wanted to stay out of my life, my previous post goes more in depth. anyway, i remembered a few times when my dad would act inappropriately- at least i think so, towards me and my 2 sisters. the first one i remember was a time when i was between age 7 and 9, my dad asked me if i had hair on my vagina. when i said no, he told me i at least had to have had ""peach fuzz"" and it really grossed me out, i didnt understand why i felt so gross at the time, but i didnt  enjoy it to say the least. another time is when he would invite my mom over, after their divorce; and my dad would always tell her he needed to ""talk"" with her in his room and i physically had to tell my mom to get out of his room and pushed her because he was going to rape her if i didnt. this happened at least 4 times im aware of, and many times she was raped, or at least claims she was. my mom told me a lot about her sexual life from a young age, she would tell me details about how my dad would rape her and how she prefers having sex with older men. i dont see why she wont just seek therapy, but it really fucked me up. my dad has also commented on my sisters weight loss, saying she will have perkier breasts because of it, something along those lines. my other sister, my father commented on ber weight gain, and has told her many times that she has a fat ass. be calls us all fat ass, and hes spanked me until i was 16. not just regular spanking either, he would pull down our pants and underwear and strike repeatedly with a belt or his hand and would bend us (or perhaps it were only me) over far enough to hit the outside of my vagina, which hurt really bad. he also asks me for massages very frequently, and is never satisfied when i massage him. there were times when i was very little that he would have sex with my mom in the same room as me and she wouls scream and tell him to stop because she couldnt breathe from his weight. he has fondled me on the outside of my clothing before, and has allegedly sexually assulted my sister, she denies that it ever happened but shows all the signs and is closer to him than anyone else in or family. another side note, ive walked in on him enough to know what his favorite type of porn is, and ive seen his sex toys and have found them on my bed before, still wet with his semen inside of it. hes the type of guy that gets violent when he doesnt smoke weed for an hour. he scares me to death and i really dont want to live with him anymore.

depression,"About 10 years again I went through what I think was a mental breakdown after losing my 3rd pregnancy. I had 4 miscarriages in a row total which left me heartbroken and very sad but that sadness then turned into depression. I noticed myself crying a lot for no reason. I didn’t want to leave my room except for work and school and I had to push myself to do that!  I remember while riding in the car I started to feel what I thought was a heart attack because it came so suddenly. I felt very nervous and scared my chest tightened up and my heart was beating out of my chest. I thought it was a heart attack but turned out I was having a panic attack. I went home calmed down and got some rest and was back to normal. From than on I would get the some feeling of fear as if something was going to happen. It finally stopped about 6 months later once I accepted the loss of my babies and went to school and work. But while in nursing school which was very stressful I felt it return. While studying for my nursing boards I was so stress and worried about passing that the panic attacks had returned I was waking up in cold sweats, screaming for help. I felt like I was going to die. I finally decided to go for help and see a medical professional. I was diagnosed with GAD Generalized Anxiety Disorder which she put me on lexapro 10mg which I hated taking because I hated the way it made me feel. So I stopped without doctors orders thinking I could heal myself without medication. I was doing great, I passed my boards got a great job and moved into my own apartment with my fiancé and life was going good. A few months later I got pregnant and a year later I delivered a healthy baby girl. I was loving being a mom especially after losing multiple babies I finally felt like life was looking up for me thank God. But once I returned back to work and became stressed out at the job I felt the anxiety and panic attacks return. I started feeling sick and went to my doctor and everything turned out great I was in great health. My blood pressure was high though 144/90 so that was a concern. So my doctor ordered me to take my blood pressure daily at home and keep a log and what I noticed was my blood pressure was perfectly normal 122/77 when I was relaxed and not stressed out but once I felt stressed and worried about work my blood pressure would get so high.

The note state that they were not renewing our leases I was devastated. My daughter loved her school, her friends I loved our little community.

My boyfriend and I began looking at house so I was happy for a while. 

Fast forward to next month, I started a new job making $2 more per hour, and in there same week my boyfriend tells me he doesn’t want to live together anymore and that he needs space when our lease is up. 

This is even more devastating, all because I suck with money. I’m really trying to get my act together I am. That’s why I got this job. 

But anyway, I didn’t think if my boyfriend who keeps repeatedly telling me he loves me would go through with signing a lease on an apartment without me.

The past year has been tough but recently things may seem to be worse than I thought.  Last year I lost my job due to an injury that required a long rehab but am now back to work at a different and better job.  Since I lost my job I have been having trouble with life in general.  I feel helpless and worthless.  I have a headache that feels like it never goes away at times is so bad that I can't talk.  Everything stresses me out and I am constantly worrying about everything and nothing at the same time.  I have so little interest in anything and it feels like I am exhausting myself just to get through each day and social encounter.  At the same time I crave social interaction but don't want to talk to anyone.  I feel like I can only do the bare minimum of my life/work/father/husband duties.  I don't think my life is difficult which makes me dwell more on these feelings.  It is like I am having ups and downs and they are becoming more exaggerated.

Basically, I have a lot of trouble making myself do homework. Every chance that I get, I use it to watch YouTube and game, and it's really fucking me up. I started university online two weeks ago, and because I haven't done any homework, I'm so far behind, way farther behind than I ever was in high school, and I feel like I can't handle it.

depression,"Over the past couple of years, I've been having a tendency to get briefly depressed from time to time. However, it usually gets better in a relatively short amount of time and I can continue doing my work, and it's rarely too serious.

That said, I've lately been going through a personal issue, and it's been depressing me a lot. I think the issue itself just provided enough of a push to drown me into depression and now I'm unable to pull myself out, unlike the previous times I was depressed and was able to pull myself together. It's been about a week and everyday I find myself slipping deeper and deeper into depression rather than getting better.

As a result, my work has been greatly suffering. I have work stacked to the top of my head now thanks to this and it's making the depression even worse. I'm trying my best not to let it affect my performance at work, but somehow I'm failing at doing that, even though I love my job.

depression,"I'm 22 and overweight. Many will say I'm still very young and physical appearance doesn't matter that much, but all this doesn't give a damn to me.

I've spent each and every 22 f\*cking years of my life being completely alone and without absolutely not a single friend. But although this lack of friends is already something serious, to me in particular it wasn't so heavy because I'm myself a person who, apparently, has always preferred to be alone, usually locked up at home and spending all the days just watching anime and playing video games.

However, I know that even if I briefly lie to myself that it isn't so bad being alone, I need only one thing for my life to really be worth one iota more: love.

But of course, how is anyone going to love a f\*cking NEET who doesn't have a job, almost never leaves home, doesn't relate or rather **doesn't want** to relate to anyone and that his maximum studies are high school and nothing more because he's an academic and intellectual failure? Damn, but if luckily he has a house because he lives temporarily with his parents, and they want to kick him out in an excessively short period of time until he gets a job that he won't get! If he's applied thousands of times and they don't even catch him to be a Burger King clerk!

But the acme of the axiom which is that this f\*cking wretch is never going to have a girl who loves him and whom he'd be willing to love with all his soul is, above all, the m\*ron is a f\*cking demanding even though he's damn geek fat NEET. I know in itself I'm not gonna get a girl who will never love me, but on top of that, when I try to find a partner online or through various apps that we all already know, apart from having a lot of idiots, I'm incredibly select and just those who are physically good or who definetely like the same things as me but also maintaining a minimum of beauty established by myself serve. And, adding to all this my anxiety since I don't know how to talk (unless it's to constantly make jokes and tell bad jokes to hide it), when miraculously I manage to contact someone (that almost always my disgusting mind has already put them in ""the sack of the orcs"") in a short time this is carried away by the wind as if it were a leaf because I only know how to stay in a simple ""hello :)"" in the chat and not much else.

And the top of that, the most sadly ironic and funny thing is that I also dream of one day having a daughter who will never exist, not only because of my obvious lack of a girl, but also my deep sexual aversion. In spite of everything I'm not a virgin, but I'm not simply because last New Year's Eve I wanted to hire a wh\*re to f\*ck in my own house since the other alternative to celebrating New Year's Eve completely alone in my house was probably suicide, and I preferred that at least I didn't die like a virgin. But once everything was finished (although I'm not going to lie, the bl\*wjob is something awesome) I realized that not only I hadn't enjoyed it at all and perhaps sex was somewhat overrated, but it even gave me an intense feeling of terror that the next few tmes (still a little today) I'd be able to do absolutely anything to avoid f\*cking at all costs. So how would I frolic with my supposedly beloved wife and later father a daughter with her? This is brutally funny, isn't it?

In conclusion, as I said in the title, all this piece of text is solely and exclusively to vent and perhaps for someone to listen and respond me. I already know perfectly well that it's completely irremediable that I, despite ""being very young yet"", will be alone (and maybe even lying in the middle of street under a bridge at night in the future) forever and never a girl will love me, or maybe yes but I won't love her because secretly in my head I'll continue to think she's an orc. Brief summaries of this I've already done from time to time (on the internet obviously, not in person because I haven't one with whom) and I've always had videos or other people with the same f\*cking sentences of ""you're still ver young"", ""you're not alone, there're many people out there who are like you or worse"", ""make an effort"", ""you'll get over it"", ""you don't really need anyone either"", ""one day you'll find that person"", ""now you don't but you'll see how in not so long it's that yes"", ""believe in yourself"", ""if you don't love yourself, how is a girl or no one gonna love you"", etc., etc., etc. And I'm sick of all this f\*cking sh\*t! I'm not a pessimist, I'm a F\*CKING REALIST: in my minds I might  make platonic dreams where I do end up being with the girl of my dreams and forming a happy daughter with her, but at the moment of truth I'm realistic and I assume that someone with conditions like mine aren't gonna achieve it or aren't gonna to be entirely happy when it ""gets"" if it does.

This I've been about to have posted on the r/SuicideWatch subreddit as well, but I don't think I'm ever gonna KMS simply because on top of all I'm a f\*cking coward who doesn't dare to make a miserable scratch even if it's by accident. However, of course, that for many years now I'm already ""dead"" and that I'm only taking my last breaths until eventually I stop breathing as we all end up hopelessly.

Nothing more to plead.

PS: Oh, and by the way, anticipating those who sometimes say ""Well, if you already have so clear that absolutely nothing is gonna be fixed, what f\*cking help do you need or what is the use of all this billet that you have written here now?""

depression,"Hi,

I'm just wondering how many of you end up experiencing isolation and abandonment from loved ones and the healthcare system at large

For context, I had an abusive childhood and am estranged from my family... as you might imagine, this combined with being autistic has not been a fantastic combo. I spent the last 2 years at a university where I could not make any friends and have been left on my own with all this trauma and anxiety. I recently got up the courage to reach out for help... I emailed more than 8 therapists in my local area to try and access treatment for all this, and reached out to some friends from school just to ask if they wanted to come and hang out with me

None of the therapists replied to my enquiry about accessing treatment despite me emailing each one multiple times (it's been over a week btw) except one who said she was fully booked, and as for my friends from home and just some company to combat the crippling social isolation well... both left me on read the first time I asked if they wanted to hang out, which hurt but I tried messaging again a couple of days later... and they did the same thing (not only this, but one literally read my message, posted a photo of themselves hanging out with another friend on their facebook, and left)

depression,"I know from experience depression and other mental illness can make it hard to even hope that there is a solution or try to seek one out, especially when if your experience is anything like mine most of the countless times that you've tried have been a huge disappointment and have made you even more hopeless, at some point a lot of people stop searching and won't find a solution unless it's handed to them.

So first a little bit about where I came from, I started having depression at a very early age, I had my first suicidal thought when I was 8 and my first attempt when I was 10, I self harmed very early in life mostly by hitting/biting myself, at age 14 I realized I was gay, my family was very homophobic and generally selfish and bad, I was ""homeschooled"" in a rural town by which I mean i didn't really get an education beyond some educational video games that essentially just covered some middleschool math. I was isolated from anyone but my family so I didn't know our relationship was so unhealthy because I didn't have something to compare it to. After I realized I was gay I became depressed and self hating to the point that I developed chronic suicidality, i got to the point i didn't leave my room except to eat dinner which was all I ate each day, this lasted nearly a decade.

When i did make friends and eventually come out at 23 my family reacted exactly as expected, my mom told me she ""just wanted to die"" every time she saw me for weeks because her feelings were more important than that i had felt that way for years, i still tried to make it work with them for probably 5 years after that, over all that time i had gone to therapy and tried about a dozen different antidepressants, in my late 20s I saw a psychiatrist, got diagnosed with bipolar 2, and over the following years tried nearly ever antipsychotic that exists, all the while struggling with alcoholism and other substance abuse.

My family had made me afraid of doctors and convinced I would get locked up if I actually talked about the severity of my symptoms, but about 2 years ago I was going to kill myself, my roommate found out and convinced me that a leave of absence from work would probably make things better and give me the time to find the right help i needed, so soon after I told my boyfriend later that night I had him take me to the hospital and the next day they sent me to a facility, that place really wasn't equipped to improve my situation, I hated it there, once I got out my boyfriend told me about electroconvulsive therapy and convinced me to try it, it didn't help right away and they warned me I might not notice a difference until 7 or 8 treatments... now I've been doing it for about two years, through trial and error I've finally found a good psychiatrist and psychologist, I've been diagnosed with C-PTSD and BPD, who put me on a beta-blocker to control my anger and anxiety and prevent me from getting overwhelmed and self harming. It's taken a lot to get here, its been expensive and still is, but despite not having a family or an education I make nearly 30k a year, I own my own home, and I've been dating the same amazing and supportive boyfriend for about 5 years.

Some of the things that helped get me here, is when I would get suicidal i would tell myself ""exhaust all your options first"" even if i thought none of them would work at least if they didn't i would feel like i tried for the sake of the people who loved me and that then it would be okay to kill myself, obviously along the way I found things that worked. Secondly if your psychiatrist or psychologist isn't helping try a new one, I've had a couple really bad ones that probably made things worse I'm glad I kept looking. Thirdly Having to deal with this for so long makes you so much stronger and more resilient than most people that once that burden is gone you can face almost anything, I haven't ran into anything that compares to my mental health struggles or the things I've faced while dealing with them, since I've been better I've had to deal with 10s of thousands of dollars worth of crippling debt, filing bankruptcy, people i considered close enough to be my power of attorney cutting me out of my life, and assault, and compared to depression it's nothing. Once you find what's right for you your life will be so much better than you imagined it could be even if its a humble living working a 9-5.

depression,"It just feels like I don't deserve love. All I've ever wanted since I was literally in grade 1 is a girlfriend. Now that I'm 21 I've only ever had one relationship, and that wasn't dating just a few week fling that was one of the most stressful times of my life. I like to think that relationship kinda ruined me and left me with more trust issues and insecurity about my own mental health problems (she came from a broken home and told me I had nothing to be sad about). It took along time after that to convince myself that it was ok to feel bad. 

Fast forward 4 or so years and I still haven't had anything close to the long term commitment to another person that I've craved since I was young. 

Then just this Monday I was playing games with some friends on Xbox when they decided it would be funny to make fun of the fact I'm single, even though I have asked them so many times to help me find a girlfriend. I figured they should probably know by now that that is a very touchy subject for me seeing as how I have been friends with most of them on and off since grade 9 but regardless they kept making fun of me. 

Now I'm 21 and have only had sex with one person and I still regret sleeping with that person because of how that relationship turned out. I can't even approach a girl I think is cute now because of the amount of times I've been rejected, not that that matters right now with the pandemic. 

So I try and find something on tinder, not even a relationship but just to talk to a girl. But I have horrible luck on there, I swipe right on nearly everyone. Usually I only swipe left on people I know or those who I know I won't be attracted to. But believe me I don't have high standards for looks and I'm not a bad looking guy, I guess I've just made to many tinders and my second tier city has run out of singles? I've had slight success a couple times, literally 2 times. Both times the girl I'm talking too asked me out and told me they like me. I wasn't the one who came on strong. But both times they found something with someone else before I had a chance to meet them in person. I'm so tired of this.

Not to mention my life practically revolves around going to concerts, concerts I have to travel for because my city doesn't have a big music scene. Anyway what with covid I can't even go out and try to find a girl the old fashion way. Not that it would make a difference, like I said before social anxiety. 

And adding to it all I feel like all I would be to a partner is a burden because of my mental health issues. I'm tired of having to be a man and start all the relationship stuff. I get women might have the same feeling of being unlovable but women also aren't the ones expected to start the convo, I literally always see women with the same issues I have in very happy relationships with men who comfort them. It just doesn't feel fair.

I know a relationship wouldn't solve all my problems but it would be nice to have someone to lean on for support. It would be nice if I could go out in the summer and do cute date things, it would be nice if I could could go to a pumpkin patch. Fuck just having someone to lie next to and hold.

depression,"I'm not going to go into details about my life and upbringing, but I'll just leave it at that most people most likely would not survive what I went through, those are my therapists words.

I'm very much past that 'suicidal and depressed' phase, I went through that all in my early teens so it is all pretty much out the way. That being said the past two or three months have been very difficult and incredibly odd, and whilst I know I'm not going to have a mental breakdown going through all of this, I'm just curious why I still feel somewhat sad, despite already declaring in my head that nothing bothers me too much.

In the past few months alone:

- My brother was diagnosed as a psychotic. He tells me women were meant to be used for nothing but 'breeding' and he said he will become president of the a world power one day and cleanse the world of 'every colored person alive'. He has recently moved away for a bit, but I genuinely dread having to see him ever again.

- My dad and step Mother have been fighting every day whenever they see each other, I have reason to believe one of them committed infidelity.

- My dad has threatened to disown me for not pursuing the same career as him.

- I sacrificed alot of friendships for this girl I was dating. We're all friends again and we're been hanging out/going out lately, but I still feel awful for letting this happen in the first place.

- My crazy biological mother sent me a naked picture of herself.

- My girlfriend broke up with me, then during that break time I got drunk and flirted with some girls. We decided to try things out again but she saw I flirted with someone (While we weren't dating!) and decided to just leave without a discussion. All my friends are telling me it's 'good riddance' but I like to believe if she just tried to talk, an amicable outcome easily would of been reached.

- We have an elderly dog called Eevee, We got her in 2005 but she is dying lately, and we will have to put her down soon. This is affecting me above all other things to be honest.

- My friend lied to me about what he was up to! I caught him at lunch with my ex. Not even kidding.

- I was forced to delete my old reddit account because I was on the other end of an oddly hilarious reddit hate wave. A girl I flirted with when I was drunk posted a picture of the interaction, and then SO much misinformation was thrown around, I am 100% convinced it was all just for reddit karma at this point. I am just disgusted by reddit sometimes. I'm not in the wrong or anything though, so ultimately I truly don't care about this. Annoying inconvenience though.

- Also my country is shitty, our power has been going out almost every single day for a few weeks now. This has impacted my work and relationships to a frustrating extent.

- I'm losing weight! 4kgs in a month, for most people this would be great, but I grew up with an eating disorder. I'm more underweight then I am comfortable with, yet I swear I am eating more. My nutritionist chalks it up to stress.

- Also one of my oldest and best friends told me she doesn't want to be friends anymore after I started dating someone. I never knew she liked me that way until then, I tried talking to her again because I do want to be friends again, but she says 'It's not the same''. Which is odd because I have dated two other girls while her and I were friends in the past as well.

- And just last night I was at my friends birthday party, but she didn't tell me she invited my ex. My ex was really drunk when I saw her and she came up to me and started crying and said ""I'm so sorry, I'm so so sorry"" over and over again. While I was sitting next to some people I was getting to know. It was so awkward, but now I'm worried? About my ex? What is wrong with me.

depression,"I don't really know where to begin but here it goes, sorry if it sounds really rambly I just need a place to put my thoughts down. 

So for a bit of a backstory because this is sort of linked to the thing that's bothering me the most right now. So my favourite subject is chemistry and I really like it cos there's a lot of cool phenomenon and all that. I started taking accelerated classes for it from when I was 15. So for 15 and 16 year olds there is this thing called the junior chemistry oympiad and I went twice, once when I was 15 and once when I was 16. So I go when I was 15, and get participation for it. No big deal I will just try again next year. Next year rolls around, I really prepare for the competition and I still end up getting participation. It was really devastating for me because I put in a ton of time into studying for it(or at least I tell myself that maybe I didn't and I am just a lazy POS). I don't think I am terrible at chemistry because I constantly help my friends and I can do most questions on my own and understand concepts really quickly most of the time. I even have a youtube channel where I usually do chemistry stuff for fun. Fast forward to after my finals for when I was 16(last year) and the problem sort of starts. So after my finals we have this gap term where we do stuff like internships and all that. I go for this Japanese exchange programme which are probably still some of the best days of my life and things start looking up. I tell myself, you know what I have a ton of free time so I will start preparing for the standard chemistry olympiad for 17 year olds now so that I get to learn something and be better prepared for next year.

And this is when everything just goes to shit. So my dad decides, you know fucking what. let's push some of my own dreams onto my son even though he is already pretty stressed and has his own dreams for where he wants to study. he enrolls me for this training programme for the top engineering colleges in India. he did ask me if I wanted to go for it and I said yes because 1. if i said no he would probably hit me and 2. i thought that since it was online it can't be super bad and I will still probably have enough time to study chem and my dad probably won't bother me too much or constantly call me a lazy POS. I was so freaking wrong. Turns out the classes happen almost every day from 10pm to 1am which is honestly fucking terrible on its own because it fucking destroyed my quality of sleep completely. I already have pretty shitty insomnia sometimes and its really hard for me to fall asleep and having to last till 1am while doing insanely hard questions destroyed me. Not only that but they give a shit ton of homework which takes up like 8 or 9 hours to do and I legit wanted to fucking kill myself from september to february. It didn't help that they had these super competitive 3 hour long exams every other week and I couldn't fuck them up because I was super scared that my dad would go after me. DUring this period of time I was pretty much crying at night every day and by the time it reached december I couldn't even cry anymore and I literally can't bring myself to cry to this day. I was really fucking depressed and I lost interest for everything that I used to love doing. I basically completely stopped gaming and lost my interest for it, I gained weight and just screwed my body image over(althought I am getting healthier now so that's a plus i guess i dont know I am still not where I want to be). I still don't find gaming interesting and nothing seems to make me happy anymore. it doesn't help that my dad doesn't let me go out with my friends more than like 4 fucking times a year and after a while I just stopped fucking asking him. I couldn't study chem like I wanted to and I was so fucking stressed while other people were super fucking relaxed. its not even like the material i was learning was gonna help me at junior college(JC) which is where I am at now. It got so bad that for december for one month straight I would literally die to some random guy stabbing me with a longsword in my dreams almost every single day. I was so done that I wanted to fucking die and was secretly hoping I would get hit by a car. 

&amp;#x200B;

So its february and my JC 1st year starts. I knew the workload in JC was gonna be insane so I argued with my dad for a month about not doing the stupid fucking training programme so that I wouldn't fucking die from stress and a lack of sleep. Luckily, with help from my mum, who I am so fucking grateful for and would have committed suicide years ago without her, we manage to convince my dad to let me stop doing the training classes even though it was pretty expensive. Things finally start looking up and I meet a few amazing people that have helped me to survive JC so far and that I am really grateful for but I guess life just doesn't like me sometimes because I get hit with 2 massive blows while this happens. So firstly, I got into this amazing 2 week exchange programme to germany that's fully paid for and I was looking forward to it so much. Unfortunately due to covid, it had to be pushed back to Nov/Dec(its cancelled now so probs doesnt fucking matter but) and that meants that it would clash with the chemistry olympiad. At this point, I literally felt super fucking sick for the week where I had to decide between a one of two week experience or trying for the chem olympiad. I honestly really wanted to try my hardest for the chem olympiad to at least try and get into the internal olympiad because it would be a dream come true but honestly I was filled with so much self doubt and in this period when I was really struggling and didn't know what to do I kkind of faltered and pestered my parents for advice. My dad got pissed and just straight up said that I should go for the trip because I Was gonna fail the chem olympiad anyway and I was a useless dumbass and would become a failure and a bunch of other stuff. I know that I am not the IIT achieving genius that my dad wants but I really try my best. I legit took up physics accelerated classes for the last two years and even got accepted for the JC version(which i eventually decided not to take to avoid the stress) and it did nothing but only disappoint him further because apparently I suck at physics even if every fucking teacher in this universe would tell him otherwise. At the same time I get into fencing which I really wanted to do but I had to drop it because my dad didn't want to finance something that I was gonna only do for 2 years and suck at even though I was willing to use up my savings for it( he would have had to cover half of it though). He just brought up the fact that I sucked at swimming and didn't want to do it even though he put me in swimming when I was 9 and against my will and would literally fucking curse me after every lesson for wasting his money but sure. Same thing happens with badminton when I am 12 cos ofc I am supposed to be able to play against people that have been learning for years after just 2 lessons because I am a year older than them. I am fucking 90% sure that my dad stopped me from doing fencing just to fuck with me and get back at me for arguing against him for the training programme earlier. After this I impulsively decide fuck it I am just gonna try for the Students Council and I get in. Honestly I don't know why the fuck I did it because olympiads and student council are a terrible fucking combination in JC because of how time intensive they both are. I was at my breaking point for so long because of both and because I had to do my council work my olympiad stuff suffered. While I do believe that a large part of the reason why I joined council was because I really felt like I could do things to make the lives of my schoolmates better and because I didn't get the opportunity to do so in earlier years, deep down something tells me that it was just an impulsive decision because I really want to get into an ivy league even though its not really feasible for me because I am probably not capable enough and I can't bring myself to work hard even though I need to because on some days I don't feel like doing anything. I just really wanted to be able to go into an ivy league man. It's been a childhood dream for me and while its much harder to do so while living in Singapore something makes me want to try at least but the self doubt really fucks with me. In June my first set of exams come along and I end up doing really well for everything apart from the general paper(my writing and english aren't great). A thing I forgot to mention is that I still have to do a 2nd language unlike most my peers because I take hindi and that thing is another time sink that has really screwed me over. Council work rolls around again and in the first mid term break for aweek I do nothing but study chemistry stuff to catch up and do council work. I did so fucking much and did more than a lot of people for council work and I was do fucking depressed and sad because it felt like I did all of this and it felt like no one gave any flying fucks. I am so fucking lucky that a few people in council really kept an eye out for me and helped to reduce my workload for the timebeing after that. 

&amp;#x200B;

So fast forward to now and its the 2nd break of a week just before my finals for this years start. On monday I have my essay for my general paper and my chemistry olympiad selection test and I feel so fucking suffocated for both. For the selection test I need to be in the top 25 out of 30 something people but I honestly don't think I am gonna make it. It feels like there are too many gaps in my knowledge and I won't be able to fix them in time. It doesn't help that after Monday I still have the rest of the my finals which end in the first week of october. If I do get selected for the olympiad I am still super screwed because my hindi a levels are on the 26th of october and the olympiad is just 2 days after that and it doesn't help that there's another a level subject just after the olympiad. These 3 months are just gonna freaking suck and I don't think I am gonna make it. I just feel like my goals of getting into an ivy league are just stupid because I am an idiot and even though I am incredibly fortunate in some aspects and I have been given so many things my laziness and stupidity are just gonna hold me back. I don't know how I am gonna deal with the disappointment of not even being able to get past the internal selection test for the chemistry olympiad or not getting into the universities of my choice and I don't know if I will be able to face myself when the time comes. I have stopped talking about this stuff to my friends because I promised myself that I wouldn't burden them with this bs anymore and I did meet a counsellor once. I might do it again in the future but my schedule is super tight for now so I don't know.

&amp;#x200B;

I legit don't feel motivated to do anything anymore. There was so much that I should have studied today but I wasted so much time doing nothing. I wasn't even using my freaking phone for a long time I just refused to put effort into bloody thinking and absorbing information its so fucking stupid. I don't know what I should do and I feel like my decision making is honestly so shit and I just wish I didn't exist so that I wouldn't have to deal with this. There's quite a bit that I haven't included here because I still don't feel like talking about some parts I guess but I don't know what I should do next. Nothing brings me happiness anymore. Watching youtube doesn't help at all pretty much it just gives me something to passively do and I have 0 interest in gaming now. I don't have any energy left for making youtube videos and I feel so upset at myself for ever sharing about some of my problems with people when I broken down earlier this year. They shouldn't have to deal with my shit when they already have so much going on. Maybe that's why I try to make people laugh so much and try to be funny. Because I just want to make people happy man and maybe selfishly try and bring myself joy for doing that. Maybe I try to be a good person not because I am actually good but because I want the satisfaction of trying to be able to say that I am good. I honestly don't know who I am anymore and I guess life's just like that.

depression,"Hello! I have a friend who may be depressed. He has mentioned it before, but I've really noticed the following things: he is reeeeaaaally negatively affected by the news, he gets down in the dumps about it and has rants about things where I don't know what to say. He is discouraged about things in his life, he complains about his friends a lot, he has trouble focusing on one thing and occupies himself with several different things, sometimes without finishing one project.

depression,"super nervous.

im super nervous

its been a while since ive actually been interested in a girl if im being honest. so im super stressed 

shes adorable. she watches the same anime as i do, has similar interests. super well spoken. respectful and a good hearted person. im hoping i dont f this up like i usually do in my life.

what does one even talk about on a date

do we talk about what makes life happy? what makes life sad?

im scared if im honest about the way i feel about life she might leave. and i really dont want that to happen

what happens when i finally talk to her about my crap.

she might leave

sometimes i wish i didnt feel like this all the time

this outward persona of happiness and non despair

this constant jovial and cheerful person that i project myself to be

why do i have to feel this way

why does everyone else have it so easy

why.

i dont know if i know what its like to feel happy.

is life just made up of slowly deteriorating happiness

is it wrong to feel only some fleeting moments of happiness and then nothing

how do people do this

am i just weak

how do i become stronger

what caused this

why did it caues this

when could it possibly stop

will it stop

one day will the moments of despair become as fleeting as the moments of happiness and will it finally be the other way around

it doesnt feel like it

wys-lone

wow

why must it be like this

why is it always like this

its like constant pressure on my chest

just forcing me to be someone im not

how is it fair that i need to pretend but other people just feel it

will a therapist really help

it really feels like it wont

i doubt it will at this point

how do i know when it stops if i cant remember what it feels when it hasnt

what happens tomorrow

do i sit next to her or opposite her

will either action cause a different reaction

what do we even talk about

the fact that i always feel like im about to explode

the fact that nothing ever even makes me happy anymore

why is this the way i am meant to live my life

why do i get thoughts of just driving into a wall

and crushing myself

cause whats the point

we all die anyway

why try now if in 20 years or tomorrow i die

just to buy a house and get married

i dont understand

i wish i had answers

wheres god now?

what is god even

is it a belief

is it a person

is it a idea

who made it

and why

just to provide a semblence of some sort of belief in something more

what is the point at all

why even try

one day to die and get told i sinned

i dont want to live

i dont want to live because it really feels like it wont make a difference

even if i had the biggest impact in the world it would be lost in a 100 years

whats the point

i dont fucking understand anymore

i wish i could just go

go anywhere 

but not in my shoes

i wish i was someone else

who wasn't burdened

burdened by crap i dont even know about

burdened by crap that shouldnt even affect me

why...

and i feel guilty for feeling like this

there are people that dont have beds to sleep in

what gives me the right to complain about my emotional state

if theres someone dying of starvation

how is that fair to them

i dont know how anymore

it takes so much for me to not just cry and die

and i dont know what to do

how will a therapist help if a therapist needs a therapist

why

and when

i hope soon

i cant keep going like this

it really hurts

shes getting glasses

the girl i like

i dont know if i should even go through with tomorrow

i dont want to burden other people with my crap

ill get told its just me

or in my best friends words that ""i just need to go out and stop being a pussy"" 

thats not fair of you

how can you just say that

that really hurts me

because it seems like you dont even care at all

and i hate that

what gives you the right to say that

after i open up to you and you say that

and then you make a whole speech about how much you care but you're forcing me to go out?

going out will do nothing for me

whats the point

go out waste money and drink

thats it

makes no sense to me at all

whats the point of that ridiculous shit

what gives you the right to tell me go out or else

im sorry but thats the way i feel

and you cant act like you care if you dont

one day you care and the next you call me a pussy for not going out

do you even understand what im going through

I am only fourteen.  You’ve given me many things, good, bad, and somewhere in between.  However, I believe I am accurate in saying you’ve given me more bad than good.  When I tell this to people, they take the opportunity to tell me, “that means the best is yet to come,” but I believe that they’re wrong.  See, you are not fair, you are not balanced.  Some people are born into pain, suffering, but then are given light, happiness.  Some are born into the light, and ride high after high, living a fulfilling, happy life.  Others drown in the darkness, day after day after day.  

You’ve given me pain, then brought me friends.  Friends I could count on.  But now, when I am spiraling, when there is nothing I can look forward to, no one who can help, you start to take my friends away.  You’ve stolen one friend from me, and it seems that you’re preparing to take three more.  How much more do you want from me?  How much more are you going to take from me?  How much more pain do you want to put me through?  

Maybe you are testing me.  Trying to see how far you can push me before I’ll break.  You don’t understand that I’m already broken.  See, there is only so much a person can take, and I reached that limit years ago.",Dear life,---_Lucifer_---

depression,"I was cheated on by my partner of 5 years. 

It wasn't an emotional affair, that's how he rationalized it.

He paid prostitutes instead and partied in hotel rooms while I was at work.

We're trying to reconcile but I feel like I'm slipping back into my depression.

I used to self harm a lot when I was younger.  I would cut and had an eating disorder for years.  I told myself I was better than that and have been maintaining my weight and would never go forward with cutting even though I still daydream about it sometimes.

I can't stop making bad decisions.  I went back to a lot of rec drugs that I had quit and stopped my antidepressants because I didn't want to mix all these drugs together.

Now, I don't want to cut but I'm going against my morals and signed up on fetlife (fetish forum) and made a profile.  I posted my pictures and I have so many men giving me compliments and wanting to talk to me.  I am strictly monogamous and in my head, this is cheating.  But I don't care anymore.  I'm posting my face and sending pics to complete strangers, how fucked is that?  I just want to be told I'm beautiful and be payed attention to, which my partner is NOT doing.

I also know that even if I told my partner, he would probably love it.  Boys don't care about monogamy.  He would probably love it that I want to fuck other people and actively encourage it.  This is just not the person I thought he was.  I thought he would covet me.  I thought I was his and his alone.  I thought he was mine and mine alone.  I just want to be treated like something special.  Not a toy to be passed around, enjoyed, and then tossed to the side.

IDK what I want with this post.  Maybe just getting it out there and showing myself that this is a dangerous path and to stop.  But I need that validation.  It feel so nice to have someone want to talk to me and make me feel wanted.  I know it's all fake because they just want to fuck me and are saying whatever they can to trick me but that still doesn't mean it doesn't feel nice.

So I've been thinking lately that I am a stranger to myself. Its always awkward for me when someone asks about my interests or what I do for fun. My hobbies, interests and things I do for fun that I tell people always feels like a lie. I dont do anything anymore, I'm not interested in anything anymore. Im telling them things that I used to enjoy close to 4 years ago. Which is unsettling in the moment and long after the conversation has ended. 

I feel very removed. I recognized that I didn't have hobbies anymore so I decided to try out some new ones and some old ones. Some of them brought me momentary enjoyment, but for the most part it just felt like doing the activity for the sake of being able to feel like a normal person or for the sake of being able to say I enjoy these things/ these are the things I do with my time without feeling like I'm lying. 

Im at a point in life where the need to decide and settle on a career is closing in and this feeling of not knowing myself  makes that choice very hard. The fact that I feel so lost on what to do makes me feel even more depressed. I dont even know what I like anymore so where do I even begin on attempting to decide a career!?
 Im also currently dealing with the struggle of work becoming close to impossible to handle. I feel like dying and I'm going into work... acting like a normal person and smiling and carrying on conversations.  It is so draining and it makes me feel alien.

For context, I'm 21 so we've been together since highschool and all of college so far. I've vented a lot to my friends in the past few days and it doesn't help, I'm overwhelmed with everything. I feel like I could just keep on talking and spamming my friends with texts about my feelings but it just gets me nowhere. It keeps me distracted and physically busy instead of trapping myself in my head, even typing this now has got me doing something but it doesn't fix the problem at hand. We lived together for almost 2 years and everything reminds me of her, I keep thinking about all the wasted memories, how much I just want to hold her again. It's so pathetic that I would even want her back but I love her so damn much.

Throughout our relationship i'll admit we argued a fair bit but 9/10 was petty moments that we really didn't even need to be upset with each other. We did everything together. You name it, sleep together, homework, drive around and go to stores, hikes, fishing, smoke and drink, puzzles, netflix,cooking,eating, all the usual couple stuff and more. She was my second half. I used to consider myself a loner and loved to keep to myself but once I was with her it all changed. 

Whats hurts the most is being alone and seeing her move on. She moved out and got her own place, working 2 jobs and barely doing school. Its like shes not even the same person. I don't want to doubt her but I know she cant physically go on like this without neglecting either school or her health. As much as shes hurt me I still worry about her so damn much, I wish she came back but she wants to be alone. I've never had to go through something like this before and the only thing I can compare it to is losing a grandparent to Alzheimer. She's still alive but its like we don't even know each other. I look at our pictures and the happy time and then look at whats going on now and its like what the fuck happened.

I don't know what I want. I think I want to move on and be with somebody else to distract me but I can't dive into a relationship after this happened because I'll just bring whoever i'm with down with me. I haven't stopped missing her or loving her and I don't know if I ever will. I need her back but I need to give her space..I need to focus on myself and work and school but she occupies my mind day and night.

depression,"Dear Reddit

Look i know the title is corny alright i get it but...thats just how i feel now and have been feeling for a while. This is the first time ill be posting here and hopefully i get some help or advice because honestly, i have nobody else to talk to about this.

So here is the situation

Im currently 18, mom passed away when i was 11 and thats when everything started falling apart. I was born in Greece, parents split up when i was 4 and had a fragmented relationship to say the best. I loved both mom and dad but as dad loved to say, ""you are a mommas boy"". She came to Australia on her own when i was 9 to seek medical treatment for her cancer (Greek healthcare is nowhere near as good as here plus she had family here she could stay with), leaving me alone with dad.

Dad was the kind of person that would be sweet to you but then show you his other side when it came doen to school work or homework. My grades started declining when mom left and so things werent great at home with dad. Anyway, mom could see my life wasnt going so well so after travelling back and forth between Greece and Australia for Christmas, we both secretely travel back to Australia where i have stayed for the past 8 years.

Now dad was obviously not a fan and for many years would try and persuade me to come back but when all else failed, he just disowned me and didnt speak to me for another 4 years. Mom on the other hand, mom was very sick and as i said by the age of 11, i stood by her bedside and said one last goodbye to her before they turned off her life support.

Now that the backstory is in order, lets gloss over sone other parts. Got bullied between years 5 and 7, moved schools multiple times, struggled with mental health which i was always told to ""just deal with"", and largely grew up for a few years with my grandparents who were...old fashioned to say the least. That relationship soon became toxic and i moved in with my aunt.

Now, my aunt never expected to have kids, never even planned to marry so i knew our relationship was going to be tough but man, over the past two years it has disintegrated. These days we barely talk, as im 18 now im expected to pay rent weekly (200 dollars/week which is insane considering i work at McDonalds). Our relationship is less so a family relationship and more of an Airbnb. I have my big HSC exams for year 12 starting in mid October and im planning to move out before then because i just cant take it anymore.

The main reason, and i wont lie here, i made this post was because i crave some sort of emotional connection. My mom, who was the only person i ever had a connection with vanished when i was at a young age, my dad disowned me, my grandparents are toxic and old fashioned, spouting stuff they know theyll regret later and my aunt has turned from the cool aunt whom she always promised to be, to yet another toxic family member whom i now have absolutely no bond with. My friends arent really the type i can talk to about emotional stuff with, my psychologist can only talk during bookings and really...i just have no one else.

Now im going to try and frame this properly because i know how scummy it can sound if i dont. All my friends around me are getting into relationships, whether they are friends from school or work. I...i just wish i had what they had and im not saying this in a selfish way. Im happy for them i trully am i just wish i could find someone just as they have not to carry my emotional baggage, but to be there to support me. Trust me i know relationships built on just each other being emotional support for one another isnt healthy but i just need someone that can be supportive. Ive been trying hard on my own for the past 7 and a half years and im slowly loosing my grip. 

Ive moved on from the horny teen mood of looking for sex and intimacy and all that and i just need someone i can talk to, someone i can confide in someone i can laugh with, cry with, hug and just socialise. As i said relationships built on carrying each others emotional baggage isnt healthy but i just need some sort of support or i feel like im going to lose it

Anyway

Thank you all for reading this. I didnt expect to write this much so i applaud you if you managed to read through all of it.  Any form of support or advice would be greatly appreciated

depression,"It's really sad to watch old friends and family members you grew up with really start to bloom. They're turning into adults, they can hold conversations and have real wit and senses of humor. They are kind hearted, competent, hard working, funny, interesting people who are taking life and living it the way it should be lived. 

And here I am wasting away, 23 years old watching from my room. I can't hold conversations, I don't do anything, I have no money at all, and it's just going downhill.

depression,"It's been a rough few weeks and I've had some time to think. My friends don't talk to me anymore. I mean, I do have *one* friend, my roommate, but everyone in my social circle shuns me for being affiliated with him (due to some high school beef that I completely forgot the reasoning behind). But more to the point, the group stopped caring about me, or just completely forgot about me entirely.

My coworkers don't think of me as a useful set of hands, just some nerd who happens to be around. I usually find myself taking more cigarette breaks at work just to calm my nerves and take my mind off of things. Barely works, though. I still find myself shutting myself out and backing into a corner after being laughed out of a conversation. When the weekend comes, I find some excuse to down a bottle of whisky with my roommate, just to dull the pain and have just enough of a ""sane"" mind in order to make it through the next week. Hell, when we play games on our Xbox's together, sometimes I feel like that bottle is one of my closest friends.

My last (and technically, only) girlfriend left me back in January. She says I was nice and I wasn't the reason she wanted to end things, but I've got a gut feeling that says that I really was. Probably the same reason no one really wants to be with me. Not through high school, not through college, and not as a working man has anyone else shown an interest in me. I'm probably gonna stay like this for the rest of my days and die alone.

This is all just getting too repetitive. I'm tired of the loneliness, I'm tired of drinking and smoking myself to death, and I'm tired of wondering what shit-stained gift life is gonna shove down my throat. Just really... tired. And I wanna take a long nap.

depression,"Well, they kind of do but they don't. You will be depressed the same amount of time but you won't get as depressed during those periods. 

The underlying mental causes for the depression are still there. Antidepressants just reduce the how bad it is. But they also prevent you from being really happy. Just like how they curb your depression they curb pretty much every other emotion. That's why I/you feel numb while on them.

And this numb feeling is fucking shit.

While on the antidepressants, if you're able to grapple and understand the causes of the depression, you can eventually work your way off of them. There's often thoughts behind your emotions. If you can understand and rationalise them out makes things easier. 

I'm currently reducing my dosage atm after almost killing myself just over 2 years ago. It's taken hard work and it's still a challenge day to day but, I believe YOU have the strength to make slow and steady progression.

depression,"hi all,

I will be turning 30 soon and this has made be cry almost every day for some weeks now. I feel like I haven't achieved anything in my life. I am currently living alone, working some odd translation jobs and finishing a master's degree that is probably quite useless but I knew it when I started it - it was a means to escape a horrible job that made me feel suicidal and to achieve something more than a bachelor's. some years ago my application for a visual communications degree got rejected and the regret for giving up on that too quickly and choosing something else instead keeps coming back. I draw, I love design but I never learned it properly, I am very into art, but none of this is enough to make a career out of it. it would also be stupid to waste any more years on studying something new again.

I have been diagnosed with chronic depression but I'm not on any medication. my only experience with it was hitting a very low point and getting what was supposed to be first prescription and the pharmacist was really reluctant to give it to me, saying I ""just need some sunshine and some minerals and I will be fine"". afterwards I just broke down because I didn't know what to do anymore and never took those antidepressants in the end. I try to make myself feel better with exercise but I always come back to this point of total worthlessness. and after two years of therapy, I frankly don't see it getting better anytime soom. I can see therapy helping someone with an acute problem, but the thing is I have felt like this for as long as I remember, or since puberty at least and I learned how to deal with it, but it doesn't really get better. I don't feel like this is a life worth living if I go on like this. my therapist tells me just to do the things I want but it's not so easy...it feels like there is a force preventing me from doing things that make me happy and I hate myself for being like this. when I look back on all this wasted time and knowing I am wasting it in this very moment...I could smash my head into the wall.

to top that off, I am currently figuring out whether I should move to the country my partner lives (we met while I was studying abroad and I had to go back) but the prospect of finding a job there terrifies me. I speak the local language, but not perfectly. I don't want to start at the very bottom again (the country I am living now in is not my country of origin, I left it at 18), the only job I ever worked full-time is connected to my local language and the whole situation makes me hate myself even more for not going into something visual before, because with that I could work anywhere. I also low-key don't want to subject my partner to having to deal with the mess that I am - they are successful, hard-working and dedicated to what they're doing, whereas I am anything but. they are pretty much the best thing in my life right now, but that's also a lot of pressure to put on someone.

I guess I just wanted to let it all out, not even sure if I am looking for any advice. thanks",I feel I have wasted my life,fluorescent__grey

I have to keep all of this shit inside because I was always “the strong one.” People looked to me when times were rough. And if I cracked or showed any emotion whatsoever then people will realize how truly fucked the situation was. 

I can’t talk to any professionals because if people find out I’m on meds then they’ll look at me different. I don’t need their sad, sympathetic looks. Or their pathetic attempts at making me feel better because from where I’m sitting, they’re the ones deserving a pity. 

They go each and everyday following a schedule like mindless fucking drones. A cog in the machine and think that they mean something. “That’s life” they say, but why? What’s the point?

Why must we suffer through our lives when it means nothing in the end? There’s no afterlife. There’s no god - and that’s a fact. What kind of god would allow everyone to suffer when he has to power to end it all?

depression,"Honestly I don't know what to do anymore. I don't know wherether I should seek out for help, so I wanna hear your opinion.

I live in different city with my sister, because we go to school here. We rent a room and we have it for ourselves. I do dishes and cleaning, because my sister claims to have a lot of homework. 

Yesterday my sister asked me to print something for her. I wanted to do it quickly, but it turned out to be text with green background, so I said no, because it would waste too much ink. I also said that she can do it herself if she wants and quit asking me to constantly print something for her. She keeps saying that she doesn't know how to do it or that wi-fi is off (I'm doing all the computer stuff), which is a lie.

So she tried to take my mouse with pushing me away from the desk. I yelled at her to fuck off, and go away, because it's my computer, I paid for it and she can do it herself. She didn't listen so I also started pushing he away.

And that's when it happened. She kicked me in my stomach. I started coughing, it was hard for me to breath, so I started hyperventilating. Adrenaline kicked in and I started pushing her away with all my force. I felt like I wasn't in control. Then she said her classic line: are you out of your mind?! implying that I started hitting her. She blackmailed me that if I don't stop pushing her away from my desk, she will make a phone call that will kick me out of high school. I didn't really care, so I said that she can.

She called our mom, lying that I started hitting her, while I went to bathroom and fell on the floor. I kept hyperventilating as I felt a lot of pain. They kept talking for about a minute and she came to bathroom to hand me the phone. Mom asked me what happened and I couldn't answer.

I calmed down after few minutes and said what happened, still lying on the floor. 

After that, I told her how to do it (even though she knew). Everything calmed down a bit. We don't talk to each other.

The moment I was lying on the bathroom floor I never wanted to cut myself so bad. I wanted to wake up at 3AM and make cuts on my hip (that's the place where I cut myself, because wrists would be too obvious).

I absolutely hate my sister, because she keeps talking how hard she studies, how she wants to cry and kill herself. I hear it on a daily, and I hate that people worry about her and don't see that I also have problems. I'm not just depressed. I'm insane. I just don't say it to every person I know or meet.

I'm from the country where children don't usually ""move-out"" unless they get married or anything and are very ""family-oriented"" where we keep our mouths shut to have a complete family. And everyday I see how my dad treats her, it's like she's not even a person that needs to be respected. We confronted him many times about his child and affair/s and yet, we get the blame for believing whoever. NO FUCKEN REMORSE WHATSOEVER.

depression,"About a year ago I noticed that there were less and less days where I was happy. At the end of the day I usually mark how my overall mood has been that day on my calendar. After a month there were no smiling faces left, only ones that were frowning. I was not really feeling sad, I was just feeling a bit empty. I figured that this might be depression, so I did a test on the internet. The result said that I most likely was suffering from depression and that I should seek professional help. I didn’t do that and instead just waited for it to get better. Of course it didn’t get better, instead it was getting worse and worse. At the start of this year I finally convinced myself to tell my mother what I was experiencing and asked her to take me to a mental health professional. She told me to wait, like I told myself to do when I first suspected that I might have depression. I waited and like before, every time I thought it couldn’t get any worse, my mental health continued to plummet. After I told my parents about the problems I was facing again last month, they told me that if things won’t get better by October they would consider seeking help. I just wish it could have been earlier because what was only a phase of mild depression has turned into severe depression. I always thought it would end soon, but what if I will have to deal with this until I die? What if it really will be the reason I die? I think I have reached a point where it’s difficult to go back. I really hope that other people don’t make the same mistakes me and my parents made. If you suspect that you might have depression for more than two weeks, don’t hesitate to seek help. If your child tells you that they think they are suffering from depression, take their words seriously. Even if it is “just” a mental illness it is lethal!

depression,"Hey there, I'm a 21 year old dude from Israel, serving in the IDF, with only 1 friend (im being generous here because recently I haven't felt that he wants to talk to me that much, and I think im being left out, again), a super overbearing mom, to say the least, with social anxiety (I guess, never had it professionally checked out) and a ton of suicidal thoughts as a cause of those things...that basically sums me up.
I absolutely hate my life, because I feel like I can do something to boost my confidence, I just don't know what, and I honestly feel like I can't talk to people about it, because they would look at me even more like a weirdo, which some people already think that of me. Im constantly tired, physically and mentally and there are so many times I just feel like a little kid, on the verge of tears, just wanting a hug from someone, but too afraid to ask for it. Speaking of my mom, the things she does and how my life is partially controlled by her is a chat and discussion for another day if anyone wants to hear...i just feel so alone, and like I don't belong anywhere, and that in a way, makes me so fucking afraid to talk to girls, except for maybe some short small talk but that's it...ehhh, and speaking of my suicidal thoughts, there were a few times where i almost went through with taking my life, but a little voice inside me told me not to do it, that something great is waiting for me down the road, but I just feel like the universe is having a lot of fun making a joke out of me.

depression,"I work a job that I hate, I only took this job during  my summer holiday to earn money because I really want to move out of home. I hate it there,  not because my dads abusive or whatever but it just doesn’t feel like home. His wife has made it abundantly clear that me and my depressive sorry ass don’t have any place there. My dad says Im welcome there but it just really doesn’t feel that way. 

This week is the last week Im working there and I was just going to give my best until friday when this is finally over. 

Today though, I just had a shit day. I’m feeling depressed as fuck, anxious, tired and worn out. Im constantly on the brink of breaking down in tears. I slept only 5 hours tonight which would usually be ok but I slept like absolute shit. 

This obviously affected the quality of my work, I couldn’t concentrate on the dull, monotonous typing of numbers into a system. I made a lot of mistakes and got only very little done. I know I should be able to control myself to the point where this doesn’t significantly affect my performance and usually I am but not today. Today just sucked. Like a lot. 

Lately Ive been having dark thoughts. Maybe my BF would be better off without me longterm, I’m just annoying everyone anyway so why not just die? Why not just leave everyone alone? I wish I was never even born. 

I don’t deserve the wonderful people around me that are always nice to me, like my friends but mostly my BF. Hes so good to me. How? How can you love someone like me? I just fucking suck. I do feel like I deserve to feel this pain and immense heaviness.

depression,"Buckle up guys, it’s a long one!

My (34f) spouse (36m) suffers from severe bouts of depression, accompanied by anxiety, social anxiety, and PTSD. After about 3 years of his revolving door of jobs, I really noticed some depression flags and asked him to see someone about it... well, he said he’s not worth it and I should just move on (his words cut me deeper than I ever thought words could). So I spoke to his family doctor about my concerns (please note that I only spoke with her because I know he trust her and would accept her opinion) and agreed. So she went ahead and scheduled an appointment with her colleague (a psychiatrist).

After several appointments, he finally had a diagnosis, and was looking at potential treatments. I was so proud of him for taking this step and let him know that I’d be there whenever he needs me and that I’d do my best to see it, but he may need to let me know sometimes (I literally told him that even if he bursts out and yells at me, that’s one way of letting me know he needs help).

He was getting things together for a job interview and noticed he was breathing really heavily so I asked what was wrong “I’m not sure if I can do it. They’d never hire someone like me, I’m worthless!” Well... I went wide eyed and showed him my bank account, I don’t make a lot of money, but enough to keep all the bills paid and food in our stomachs, maybe you see where this is going, I said that if he didn’t feel comfortable going out to work it probably means that he needs more time and adjustments to his treatments so I would take care of it and he should take the time he needs to work on himself.

Now it’s 5 years later, we’ve been together for 8 years, I stuck with him through it all and I don’t regret my decision to give him the time to work on himself. It’s been difficult sometimes, but it’s also been amazing sometimes, he’s my partner and I still love him (maybe more now than before). I told him I was having a little trouble keeping up with maintenance calls to our apartment because they can only do the work when I’m working, and I asked if he felt up to taking on the responsibility of taking the maintenance schedule and reminding them of things that aren’t yet taken care of? He agreed and told me not to worry about it.

Now we’ve been having an issue with one of these things and he said he didn’t want to deal with it anymore, I accepted that and called the landlord back reminding them that this list is STILL not done. I told him I called and would take care of it, he yelled “well if you had done it back in January it wouldn’t be an issue now! Get the f*** out of my life you stupid cow!” Now I’ve had to take some harsh words from him in the past because I had come to notice that if I just let him have his little meltdown and just go on like it didn’t happen he recovers from it easier. But this one hurt, BAD. I developed some very thick skin, so I can take a lot and just let it in one ear and out the other, but he knows that I can’t handle being called stupid (I really don’t know why, but it seems to only be when someone insults my intelligence that I actually hurt). So I stood near him until he was done, went to the bedroom and cried for a bit until I could compose myself and come back to ask him if he’d like another coffee...

So, I’m seeing this as him asking for help, cause I told him that I would, and though I honestly kinda just want to tell him to grow up, I know that wouldn’t help AT ALL! 

What should I do to let him know that I’m here for him, but also let him know that he actually really hurt my feelings without belittling him or making him feel even worse than I know he already does?

depression,".. I'm having an awful day, sadly. And besides not really having much money there's nothing really to be sad about for me at least. I have enough to eat and my own apartement, my gf is here everyday and pracitcally lives here with me, but I still drop into holes every now and then.  
I've have to deal with hard depressions over the last 7/8 years again and again. I managed to stop doing drugs.. I was deep into pretty much everything you can get some years ago, and almost died having an overdose and pairing it with antidepressives back then. Those drugs made it even worse and at times I wasn't able to work, I wasn't able to take a shower and I was just laying in my bed crying for 3-4 hours straight for no specific reason.. Somehow I managed to get over with that extreme, but still to this day, I randomly have days inbetween my work and my daily life where for some reason I just feel sad, very sad. I have issues feeling joy to the fullest, I can't even do so, it feels like my emotions most of the time go in a straight line that are not even at average and at certain time just drops a whole lot for a whole day or two. Today is one of those. And I cant tell you why it is like that sadly. I just know that it was way worse then years ago where I was addicted to drugs and on top of the addiction wasn't able to do the most basic stuff.. For now Iam hopefully finishing my second apprenticeship, I'm in the last year of beeing a curative teacher.. somehow funny isn't it?  
Iam dropping out of work and school on those days, more regularly then other people, but I do a very good and approved/ appreciated job at work. My marks were always good, and for my whole life I need to hear people telling me Iam unusually ""intelligent and empathic"", and they oftentimes adore my ability to feel and understand others. Yet I personally can't make use out of this for myself, and I dont like hearing that. I'm just here for others it feels like and thats what keeps me going.  
Iam still figuring out how to enhance my ability to feel better in everyday life, but I'am struggling.  
 I do have goals, because I know thats what I should go for and It would be the right decision, yet I dont feel the excitement like other peoples do chasing their goals. When I somehow achieve things that were really hard for me I don't feel proud of it. It doesn't matter if it was stop doing drugs and selling weed after 8 years, or if it is simple stuff like doing physical excersise.   
Everyone in my near, social environment saw me drastically worsen in terms of physical and mental health due to constant depression, drug usage and unemployment. Facing the police, got away lucky, still continuing to do illegal stuff and taking drugs.  
I somehow managed to drop my lifestyle of beeing a drug addict last year, after a very impactful incident, creating the worst day of my life.   
I managed to be ""normal"", without any drugs that formerly determined my daily routine to the maximum. I continued my apprenticeship, with very good marks and Iam beeing told, like mentioned above, that iam unusual in a positive way (I hate to talk about me like that btw.)   
Yet after all this change and positive feedback, which I guess not everyone would have managed to do, I dont feel satisfied or good about it. I want to be as excited as other peoples are chasing their dreams and accomplishing small goals on that road. Living in my own apartment, not doing drugs anymore and having good grades doesn't make me feel good at all, and it doesn't enhance my motivation, which is not really existend anyways. I do this, because I know I can and should, but not because I FEEL it. Iam almost certain I do what I want and especially working with people that have mental or physical disabilities gives me a very good feeling, because I see the impact I have on their lives helping them out. I was working as a nurse in a home for elderly people and made my first apprenticeship there, overall for about 4 years. I couldnt finish the apprenticeship because I lost my workplace due to a guy telling my boss I would smoke weed and such. I was in the last year back then as well. The job was fulfilling and even if I was working like an idiot and felt exhausted everyday, the smile I could create in those peoples faces and the way they appreciated my empathic and considerate way of working was everything to me. Losing that job really was devastating..   
Well I don't even know where this is going here, I think I made my point. It is hard for me to feel myself in a positive way, besides helping out others I dont get that joy. How do you people out there achieve this. Iam jealous and sad, because I want to feel this joy, like I did about almost everything back in the day where I was a kid at the age of 7\~. The feeling I went with throughout the day was essentially different, I had a will and a good feeling unless something really bad happened.

depression,"Today, I was at the post office to collect welfare. Last May, I had suicidal ideation and it took until July for me to seek therapy. I lost my job due to Covid and I've been looking for a job since March.

At the post office, it was packed with people seeking welfare and the queue went out the front door. I prepared myself, getting into a podcast behind my mask and my headphones. I've had a hard time lately, my depression starting before Covid and being triggered by it in losing my job and actually getting the illness last April. I've gotten 1 interview, which I've still to hear back from, and I'm undertaking a new venture as a freelance illustrator / artist. Creating art helps me to deal with my trauma and it has lightened my load, along with weekly therapy. 

I hear a woman yelling at the post office staff. She has that drawl you'd expect from someone addicted to drugs (aka a junkie, but I don't like calling people that). She had skipped the line and demanded her welfare payment. She's pushed to the back by a security guard and I hear her call my name. I turn, flabbergasted. She's an old peer from school.

She's incredibly gaunt, looking about twice my age. We're both 26. She looks embarrassed as she starts asking me how I'm doing. I just say I'm doing okay and she doesn't want to say anything else. This woman was an obnoxious troublemaker at school - she was only friends with her own gang, and everyone else was a target.

I've had a hard time but shamefully, this incident made me get some perspective. Suffering is relative - we all deal with own stuff. But chances are, I'll come out of my slump at some point and she won't. I felt guilty for having suicidal thoughts last May. I have my first solo exhibition this October! It's a mini one in a cafe, but still. I'm working on getting better because I have so much going for me, even if it doesn't feel like it.

Ten hours later, I decided to just disappear into another city. She must of not called the cops on me since I was able to get an apartment, I guess she was just happy to have me out of the house. Two months later, my life just hasn't been the same, I have entered an alternate reality. I may not have registered as a sex offender or gotten that ass whopping her family members wanted to give me but deep down inside I know I'm a criminal and it's what will forever define my life and I have nothing but guilt. I had it good where I used to live, childhood home for +20 years, close to the beach, three cats that I love and miss and the beautiful women that lived around that I could have hooked up with...and instead I threw it all away in mere seconds. I can't even look at women anymore, I can forget about relationships or having kids. Now I have absolutely no one in my life and no one to talk to.

depression," I am a 21 year old male student in Australia. My biggest problem is what I strongly suspect to be Complex PTSD. I have been diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder, severe Misophonia and severe Depression. However Complex PTSD is my biggest concern.

I have no conscious memory of these events, but I found out, after asking my mum last year, that I was physically and sexually assaulted by three much older students while I was in kindergarten. This happened repeatedly, every recess and lunchtime for several weeks. I didn't know how to explain what was happening, so when I cried and refused to go outside for recess and lunch, the teachers forced me to go outside anyway, assuming I was just being badly behaved to get attention.

For as long as I can remember, I have never felt any inherent value to life. I do feel that there is value in experiencing pleasure and in avoiding suffering, but no value in being alive in and of itself. I don't gain any positive feeling from being alive, and if I found out I would die tomorrow, I would be indifferent, I wouldn't really care. Life isn't a special thing or a good thing in my eyes, and never has been.

Overall so far, life has been mostly a negative experience. When I'm just sitting on a bench doing nothing, or doing an emotionally neutral task like brushing my teeth, I feel mildly sad. Mild sadness seems to be my natural background state, with ups of mild happiness and downs of severe sadness, but always settling back down to mild sadness most of the time. So far, I would say that life has not been worth living. It has felt bad, and I haven't achieved anything that matters to me. Though I feel like whatever I achieved, it wouldn't matter to me, since I don't feel there's any inherent value in anything, I don't believe in any ideology or religion, I don't feel a sense of belonging with any community and I feel I have no purpose and that the world wouldn't be any different regardless if I was born or not.

I feel disconnected from other humans, and often when I bring this up people dismiss it as ""oh, that's normal when you have autism"", but no, I have a lot of friends who are also on the autism spectrum and the disconnection they describe is a different feeling. The disconnection I feel is on the deepest, most spiritual level imaginable. At my core I do not feel any affinity with the human race. When I look into a human face, I do not see myself any more than I do when I look into an ant face, or into a rock. I feel compassion with humans, I have friendships with them, but I do not feel I \*am\* them. I feel that everyone else has some indescribable essence of ""human-ness"", and I have an empty hole inside me where that human-ness is supposed to be. 

I feel slightly repulsed by the appearance of human faces. I feel that animal faces look pleasant, but human faces look unnatural, like some kind of weird, stiff melted spoon. Humans kind of gross me out. I don't like touching them, even though I am perfectly comfortable touching animals or plants. Humans just have an inherent ""gross-ness"". I have never felt sexual attraction to a real life human. I have felt sexual attraction to animated characters, mostly animal characters, but also some human characters which spend a lot of time around animal characters, or have animal like features like pointy ears and a tail. But I have never felt sexual attraction to a real physical human being. 

Sometimes, the environment around me will just stop feeling real. I can still feel, hear, smell, etc. It's just that it all feels ""fake"". It feels like I'm walking around inside a computer game in a digital body. Like everything is hollow or made of plastic. This feeling that nothing is real occurs randomly, and lasts about 10 minutes before quietly fading away.

It usually takes me 2 or 3 hours between getting into bed, and actually falling asleep. Generally, I have to do a single, repetitive task for hours, like alphabetically sorting files on my computer (with blue light filtered out to stop it keeping me awake), until eventually I finally get lulled into feeling sleepy. Once I do feel sleepy, I pretend to be one of my favourite fictional characters cuddling with their loved ones, and I'm able to fall asleep. When I wake up, I never feel rested. Even when I get a solid 8 or more hours sleep, it makes no difference. I still feel groggy and completely out of energy all day, every day. Caffeine helps, but only if I use it once a week, no more often than that. And it only lasts a few hours.

I have a deep fear inside me, which often manifests as rage, anger, grief, sadness or fatigue on the surface, but I think that deep down it is fear. I think that deep down I am scared that because people exist in the world with more power than me, that they could hurt me if they ever chose to, and nothing could stop them. I managed to keep this fear quiet for many years by convincing myself that willpower was the strongest force in the universe. That as long as I wanted something more strongly than anyone else wanted the opposite, and I put 100% effort into it, then I would have my way. And therefore I would always be safe. However, this belief was undermined last year when I campaigned really hard for months for my favourite character not to be removed from a long running video game series, and he was removed anyway. That proved money and influence outweighs willpower, and so, I'm not safe.

In the immediate aftermath of that, I felt the most intense emotional pain of my entire life. Extreme anger, extreme sadness, extreme self hatred. I would randomly break out crying in class, there would be days where I physically couldn't force myself to move and I would stay in bed all day, curled up as small as I could make myself. I was in so much emotional pain all day, every day, that I made plans to kill myself at a specific time, and had the means to do so, but I was talked out of it by an online friend, and went to hospital instead. At the time I thought I was childish and weak and fundamentally degenerate beyond all repair for feeling so upset over a video game. But I've since realised that I wasn't actually upset over the video game, I was upset over being sexually abused, and the video game simply undermined the defence mechanism I was using to keep my fear of the world out of my conscious life.

I am not in that intense pain anymore, thanks to a very high dose of Effexor, but I am still very tired, and mildly sad, all day every day, and life is an overall unpleasant experience. I don’t want to kill myself, but if I were to die today, I would say I didn't have a good life, and overall, life wasn't worth it. 

I desperately want to stop feeling like this. Somehow, I want to feel like I AM human. I want to feel like life IS worth living. I want to NOT feel uncomfortable with the fact that people exist with more power than I have. But I don't know how to do that, and I need help. And the key word is ""feel"". I don’t need to THINK life is worth living. There are plenty of rational reasons life is worth living. But no matter what I think, I don't FEEL like it is. Somehow I need to make these feelings stop. All I want is just to have the same sparkle in my eye as everyone else. I just want to be able to be glad to be alive. But I don't know how to do that, and I need help to learn how.

I have been trying to see psychologists through the public health system, but both the psychologists I've been assigned to have not understood what I'm telling them at all, and have either not given me solutions at all and dismissed everything as being due to my autism, or they have given me completely useless solutions that didn't change anything and have interrupted me when I try to clarify what I've said or try to describe my feelings. They keep assuming I mean something else and won't let me explain what I'm actually feeling and it's so frustrating. They end up making me feel worse than when the appointment started. So at this stage, I've given up on the public system, I just want to get better, no matter what it costs.",Overwhelmed by Complex PTSD,Haunting_Tension1077

&amp;#x200B;

So, here's me. I'm 18 years old, turning 19 this fall. I live in Germany with my mother and older sister. None of us are German and I have zero feelings for this country. Which is convenient because I am leaving for Italy soon, to gonna study at the University of Pisa. 

Probably my biggest accomplishment, since it took quite a lot of bullshitting to let them accept me, and even then I got a special deal, so to say. The thing is, I quit school just about two years ago halfway through 10th grade and went on to travel through Europe and America with my girlfriend. We got engaged. Then eventually, we ran out of money and her gap year was close to done (she had already enrolled at an American college before I quit school, just deferred for a year), so she stayed behind in the US to go to school.   
The plan was that I'd follow her, so I went back to Germany, did my GED here (yes, you can do that), took the SAT. I actually ended up getting a pretty good score, I remember her telling me she was proud. And a few colleges did accept me, which also made her proud. But all of them were far too expensive. So I stayed. 

And now I had a 9th grade diploma from a German middle school (and if I can let you in on a grand secret, my grades were shite) and a GED to my name. I assume that makes it a bit clearer how many hoops I had to jump through to get into one of the top universities in Italy. The catch? I need to take 3 semesters of a foundation course before I can start my degree studies. Fine by me. At least it doesn't cost an arm and a leg.   
My fiancée is still in the States, except she's no longer that, because we broke up. The long-distance thing just didn't work. She was my best friend and the love of my life (and I really do mean that), but I guess being apart for so long changed something for her. She's seeing a new guy now, and though we're still on good terms, she is increasingly talking less and less openly to me, I feel. Case in point; last week she told me, to put it bluntly, that she can't be fully there for me anymore and that I should go to a therapist if I'm feeling like I am right now. She knows very well I quit therapy to afford tuition and moving to Italy. She's a good person, but I know very well she doesn't have a lot of overhead when it comes to tending to others emotionally -- she gets overwhelmed very easily -- and it seems using all or even most of that capacity for me is not on the table anymore. 

Italy will be a breath of fresh air, but breathing onto a rock can't turn it into a pearl. The thing is, I don't think most of you would be superficially disappointed with my outlook for life. I'm not an introverted antisocial slob, so when I found a girl from the university I'm going to on Instagram, I texted her and said hi -- fast forward, we now have a groupchat we're running together with (almost) everyone from my course in it. I'm good friends with most of them, and the first girl actually confessed to crushing on me a while ago. Not sure how that works when we've never met, but I'm not gonna tell her off. She says she wants to ""try something"" when we see each other on campus. Hear hear. 

Otherwise, I'm in pretty good condition physically and I've somehow taught myself to keep respecting my nutrition and exercise regimen even when I feel like I should just throw myself off a roof. Don't know how that works either, but it does. So in other words, not too shabby. But here's the thing; I feel so thoroughly mediocre it's not even funny. There's nothing, and I do mean nothing, quintessential about me. You know how people call footballers or models vapid because all they care about is looks and money and fame? Well, I wish I could say I even cared about that, honestly, because that would be better than nothing, which is what I have. Nothing moves me.   
I don't mean that I have nothing to do, of course I can fill my day with useless junk if I try. And I don't mean that nothing in life means anything to me either. I am a big sucker for the arts, and I guess I have a stronger drive to fix some of the political screwups in this world than most people. But when I think about those things, I just consume what others have made. I can talk to you for days on end about some of my favorite movies, but if you present me with the idea of ever having anything to do with one myself, my brain can't compute that. I wouldn't even know where to start, it's beyond me. That goes for everything. You might say I am just plain uncreative.  


The thing is, nothing that I do means anything, and everything that means something to me is unattainable, for one reason or another, whether I understand it or not. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not trying to ask for help, or understanding, or much of anything, really. I just feel so terribly alone, and I have a hunch that that is not going to change for quite some time. At the very least, it'll be long before I ever have another person I can really open up to and share these things with, like I used to with my fiancée. So that's why. No higher reason.

But end day those things never get given in return, when you most need it.. everyone so easy to take but they hesitate as soon as you require help yourself.. like yeah doesn’t help iv put up walls as such to prevent people from coming into my life etc but it’s just difficult when that’s all your use to.. being used but not being able to get mad at people about it. 

Trying to understand  people but end day I’m the one that gets burned. Then I’m right back where I was alone again.

SOME FACTS ABOUT ME

When I was a little girl all I ever wanted is to dance and sing. I would perform in front of people. I loved to sing and make up stories and write stories to my father. I unpologeticaly spoke my mind. I always had a great sense for helping others and having a need to do something good. I am a very loving and gentle person. Helping people helps me. I brought people together to sing. Any living creature makes my day. I absolutely hate maths. I have a strong sense of self and my own aesthetic that I stick to. I always had bad grades in school. I loved music and movement. Any other subjects were just there and I ALWAYS HAD TO FORCE MYSELF TO STUDY..my interests in most of those subject really declined in years. I danced ballet for 9 years, but I wasn't a good match for a ballet dancer(too expresive, too bold, small feet, feminine figure, a bit too cury for ballet). I tried modern jazz, jazz ballet but my self esteem during adolescence declined so much that I couldn't look myself into the mirror. I felt discouraged and disgusting. That fear of underachievement was too overwhelming. And also, in higshcool and had to study so much so I didnt have much time for dancing lessons. Even though it was the only thing that made me feel alive. But I started singing in different choirs. I loved it. But after years and two different choirs I stopped that too. My first year in college I was in choir but it took too much time. But oh it made me feel free when I sing. One of the few things in life when I feel good about myself is when I sing. But again...the weight of underachievement and fear and low self esteem. Now I am terryfied of performing in front of others. I simply freeze. I have a guitar and I sing every now and then and write songs. I have about 15 songs now because I wanted to finish my album. I still dont have a gear to finally record it and publish it. Lately I dont even feel like doing music, because I am not that good at playing guitar because I didn't go to music school. I wasted my time doing things I ""had"" to. I started to go to solo singing classes but were too expensive. So I decided to end this as well because my parents couldn't afford that.

BIEFLY ON MY BAD CAREER CHOICES

After highschool(4 years ago) I made poor choices about college. I decided to live in student doorms in a different city that's 1 hour away from my hometown. Already  moved 7 times. So every year I have to move somewhere else, or at least I feel lost beacuse I don't know what's coming next. I still kind of live in the other city and come home every now and then. I have quite a broad social circle there, have things to do, people to meet. At home I feel isolated. but we have a beautiful house and surroundings, I have almost no expenses practicaly.
First I decided to go to Analytical sociology and after a month I realized it was a mistake..I wasnt interested in any of the subjects. It was preety clear I didnt look into it at all..I was too young to know how important the decision actualy is. I didn't even have the knowledge about what is important to me, what actually suits my personality..I just made poor asumptions based on external motives. So then I dropped out of college and had to return the money for scholarship so I went to work several jobs (tea place, restaurants, night club) and also as an aupair in Irland to pay back the money. 
After a year, I've met a lot of people who studied biology, I went on field work with them and I really enjoyed determening species and different methods. I had one more choice I could make to apply for college(because I already quit before). So I looked into all Nature science programes and I couldn't apply for biology because I didnt score enough in graduation's final exam. So I looked into programes that were similar to biology, and I found agronomy. And thought that subjects were quite nice and seemed interesting to me. I knew that this had to be the right choice this time! Even if it's not, I will force myself into finishing at least bachelor's degree! 

RELATIONSHIPS

From first grade of highschool on I've been in relationships. From one person to another. I couldn't stand being alone. Of course all those relatinships were quite tragic. In Highschool I was terrified of people abandoning me so I was extremely clingy. Low self esteem. I couldn't stand being with myself and when I broke up with them, I would just lie in bed crying. My entire life turned upside down. So I already had this terrible attachment style that would completely destroy me. And again, just half a year later I had a new relationship, just before I applied to college.  We were madly in love even though I was still paranoid of being abandoned. I was also anxious about the fact that his ex was his best friend, they knew each other from high school. She was studying biology and because of his admiration of her I subconsciously adopted those interests that he admired and found fascinating. This is the part that is problematic- I wasnt stable enough to make decisions based on my own interests. I wanted to belong somewhere and to someone but also be admired. We lived together for a year. Ended with him ghosting me from his life and me being unable to cope with his decision. o I had several one night stands, drinking, drugs...I was thinking about ending my life. I didn't have a stable life and all I could do is go back home to my parents. They would moralise my bad decisions of course, but at least provide me a safe support and take care of me, listen to what I have to say. That same year my ex broke up with me I had a gap year, worked my ass off part time jobs, just to pay my rent and fuck around. I still had some exams to finish for the first year. So after half a year I decided that It was best to drop the work and go home to finish exams. So I finished exams in the summer (except one, I still haven't done) and was quite happy for almost half a year! I got over my ex(mostly) and continue with studying into the second year. I decided to start seeing a therapist. I still had some one night stands and some toxic relationships with people who had trouble commiting. But I ever felt so hungry and in constant need for something more. I met a nice person after I decided not to date. We became very good friends after I told him exactly what I am writing just now. He was the first person to really see me and decided nevertheless, to stay in my life and talk with me about it and be my friend. What is more, he is that kind of a person that put an entire mirror in front of me. I could see my actions and reasons behind all this. I could see my path is not really a choice I would make as a healthy individual. This is not what a 7 year old me would ever want. Well.. my needs acted out and we kind of decided to be together as a couple. It was not a right time, we were not compatible and I couldn't feel anything any longer. I was and still am just empty. All we did is drag each other down with over analysing every single thing. But because of that person I' ve reached the point where I did see all this lying to myself. All distractions and poor decisions that were driven by my piercing pain. And I felt from ""knowing myself is easy and automatic"" cliff to a deep existential crisis pit. I think that a moment I stopped lying to myself that things could work between this person and me I started to fall into the pit of nothingness. But we are good friends now..we talk regularly and he really wants to know how I am doing. He was the first person to tell me that the career I would choose Is totally different and that I'm just suffering and wasting time.

FAMILY

My brother is 7 years older. He was really a problematic teenager. Liying, stealing, skipping school. There was this weird sexual abuse between use when I was 12 or something. He didnt really love me so that was my way of plesing someone and being any good. Well now he is 30 and has a gf and he is way better and financial stable. He is doing great and he found his way of living.
My mom can be a loving INFP but out of poor career choices and unhealthy family conditions is quite narcissistic. (her mom had a BPD and was very abusive so she had a parent role at a young age) Her parents were quite busy with jobs so her older sister took care of her. She hated my mom because she was too much to handle and annoying. They fought and were abusive to each other.
So my mom is very quick tempered and was sometimes beating me when we were studying maths together. Calling me names and yelling at me and kicking me and pulling my hair and slapping me. I was yelling at her too. That kind of stopped in high school when I started to be a bit more individualistic.
My father is very gentle and too kind. He has this overly protective and patronizing behaviour towards me. He doesnt know how to stand up for himself. A bit naive, which caused him some bad choices in his career. He was raised without a father. I always thought that he would be better off my mother, because of the toxic nature of their relationship. She is calling him names when they argue, threatening him, throwing things at him, they fought in early stages of their relationship. My father went in prison for about 2 years just when I started to go to high school (political matter) So at that time we had a strong financial crisis. My mom lost about 10 kg, was drinking in the day. Inviting ""friends"". It was just a weird time. She was just hopeless and impulsive. Depressed. 5 years ago my father came back and now everything is somehow ok. Financially we still kind of struggle but my parents are way better. They don't fight as much. I admire the fact that the went through such time together. So I try to be grateful, not blame anyone, take responsibilities in my actions because after all I really do live as a privileged individual.

So here I am, in the second year of agronomy. I maybe did 4 exams in the entire year, I would need about 30 more credits to go into a third year. I AM TIRED. Tired of my mistakes. I feel lonely even though I have people who call me and ask me how I am. I cant stand this bachelor's any more. I hate my classmates. I despise them. I feel like a live for someone else. I live in a false reality that I can't escape from anymore. I don't have a reason to wake up and I'm most likely to be obsessed with being in a relationship.
So What is my next step? I can't force myself into doing those exams because It makes me miserable and I barely focus at all. I'm gonna drop uni and have a gap year again. Work somewhere to earn some money. I'm not sure if its a good idea to stay with my parents. I know they want to help me but I feel isolated and dragged into submission. All I know is that I need to rest my body a bit. Rest my mind. Look into my possibilities to study in Europe on a low budget. I really can't make a good and relaiable choice right now because I am in no position to trust myself.

I was 5, mom was 24 at this time. My dad stayed to work in that country. I can understand that my mom was young, and i forgive here that she left me countless night home alone……and i was so young…….. She met another guy, he is an alcoholic too. I watched him how he was yelling at my mom and sometimes he even beat her. When i was 7, they got a daughter, my step sister. I was looking for here all the time, many hours we were home alone as mom and my stepfather were working. I love her very much, but she got all the attention from them….care, money, everything. If i asked for something, they told me ask dad…..and he was coming home only on holidays, thats about 3,4 times per year.

depression,"Might be abit of a confusing titel, and there will probably be alot in this that i cant really put into words but i will try my best to make sense. Also pardon my english, its not my native tounge. 

Today, after having an allnighter before work, staying up and really thinking, trying to put togheter the pieces of what we call life for the 12753th time. Wondering why im feeling so heavy, why im always smiling to everyone when i have this gloomy clouded mind that is everything but happy. Wondering why im so anxious and stressed about work, relationships, the future and the past. Whats wrong with me? I shouldnt be depressed, i dont actually have it rough, i have a rather good life if im looking at it objectively. But still things from my past keeps dragging me, my enviroment annoys me, im trying to please people but i dont actually like them.

But after putting the knowledge i have at my disposal, for some reason, this allnighter ended diffrent. 

I pulled the f*cking plug. 

I visualised it like im sitting in a bathtub, the sticky heavy liquid around me is all the things that stress me, haunt me and annoys me. All my worries about what the meaning of my life is, what im supposed to do with my future and what i could have done diffrently in the past. I pulled the plug, on everything and stopped giving a single care for it in that moment. 

And it was such an amazing feeling i havent felt in so long. Not just thinking it, but understanding it and beliving it. Understanding that while the past is important, its just as important to leave it as the past. While the future is important, its also only that, the future. Feeling lost as a 25 year old guy is okey, normal, and not wierd. Not understanding life is okey, heck most people around me dont understand life either, neither does all people in theyr 50s. And i wont let others consume my energy anymore, endlessly trying to do everything for someone else.

I will do things for myself, me, this guy. I will be nice to people around me couse i want to. I will help others couse i want to. I will love certain people couse i want to. And thats alright, thats how it should be. Im sure i will fall back momentarily multiple times again, but i will engrave this moment in my mind and slap myself back to that moment to remind myself. 

I will experience trouble, stress, anxiety, sadness, happiness, calm, excitement. Why? I dont know, and thats the point. 

I will have to carry new problems in life, but when im done fixing them, i wont stash them on my shoulder, i will leave them behind and keep moving. 

I hope maybe it gave someone out there on a similar journey some help, or whatever really. I just really wanted to write this, so i dont care.
